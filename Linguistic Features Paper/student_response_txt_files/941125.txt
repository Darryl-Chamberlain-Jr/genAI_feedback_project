The United Nations Security Council voted to pass a resolution on November 15th to call for the immediate release of any hostage being held by Hamas and to increase and extended humanitarian corridors to help save and protect more civilian lives (United Nations 2023). Out of the 15 council members who voted on resolution 2712, nine voted in favor, zero against it, and three abstained from voting, which were the United States, United Kingdom, and Russia. Israel believes that this resolution is detached from reality and stated security councils have no sway with terrorists, so they are willing to do whatever it takes for their country to accomplish its goals. Israels representative, Mr. Miller went on further and stated that the war would end immediately if Hamas laid down their arms, handover all their hostages unharmed, and turn themselves. This didn’t help to resolve the conflict, but it is allowing for much needed aid, especially medical supplies, fuel and clean drinking water to get to the civilians of Gaza who are stuck in the middle of Hamas and Israels conflict. There has been no other legal tools or mechanisms that have been used and successfully worked in mitigating or resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. President Biden has had a two-state solution plan for peace between Israel and Palestine for years. Due to failed peace talks, logistical issues, Israel expanding their settlements, recurring armed clashes, and the most recent Hamas attack on the Israeli music festival in October has dwindled support and made this plan next to impossible to accomplish (Treisman 2023).   One suggestion that came from this week's reading that could help with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is using conciliation, which is a dispute method that combines elements of enquiry and mediation (Yeini 2020). Conciliation uses third parties to investigate a dispute between two parties and present them with formal proposals for a possible solution to be decided on. The conciliation commission is made up of experts with no political affiliation and will have to investigate the facts and submit non-binding proposals for a solution to the parties. By having experts who have no political affiliation, it will help ensure a fair investigation and proposals and avoid any future arguments of one party saying they got the unfair end of the deal. Another article from this week's reading discussed the importance of domestic legal systems and post-conflict justice. It mentions that the Middle Eastern countries approach is to focus more on community interests, repairing relationships, and maintaining honor and unity (Cox & Nostrand 2022). This should be a method looked into once a peace deal is agreed upon, the Palestinians will appreciate this approach more than what Western countries may want them to do, ensuring a higher chance of peace being maintained.   Cox, J.

Instead, they continue to waste troops, resources, and money on it to see who gains control. Instead of fighting for who controls the contested region, they could refocus those resources, money, and manpower back into their economies. Pakistan's poverty rate rose from 34.2% to 39.4%, putting it as the lowest per capita income country in South Asia. They also have the highest number of out-of-school children in the world. So by refocusing energy and resources back into their economy, improving their citizens' lives. India's economy is not much better off and could really use the money and resources to improve their citizens' living conditions. India not having to put soldiers at the border to contest with Pakistan would also help relieve pressure on being spread too thin since they also have to worry about China. They could refocus their military efforts almost completely on the border that they share with China, further shoring up their defenses in the Galwan Valley where border clashes have been taking place (Markey & Scobell 2023). Would you bring these issues to these two and see if that would help them come to the table to make an agreement?  Markey, D., & Scobell, A.

United States Institute of Peace. https://www.usip.org/publications/2023/10/three-things-know-about-china-india-tensions [name]  Unfortunately, in war, innocent people always get caught in the middle and suffer by either getting injured or die. Having previosuly worked with the United States Navys F-18 fighter jets, I know that jets are capable of almost pin point accuracy if they are using guided bombs and missiles. But the pilots rely on intel and are told where they need to strike precisely, not just have free reign and blow up anything they deem a target. Unfortunately, that intel can be wrong or old, and the target has moved onto a new area or civilians were mistaken to be the target. Hamas is also known to hide amongst civilians since they know Israel isn't out to kill civilians, so they might hesitate on attacking. If Israel does attack and civilains get injured or killed, Hamas will turn around and use it as footage or picture proof that they do not care who they harm and are willing to let innocent civilians die U.S. Department of State 2023). In turn, this makes Israel look bad in the worlds eyes, including allied nations governments, causing the loss of support. What would you adivse Israel to do when it comes to trying to take out enemy targets?   Israel-Hamas Conflict: Latest Updates. (2023, October 7).

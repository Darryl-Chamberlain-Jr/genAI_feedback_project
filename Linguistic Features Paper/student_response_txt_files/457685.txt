Hi everyone, I will discuss question 5. The student did not distribute the exponent properly. Should have used the rule: \left(AB\right)^c=A^cB^c. So the first step should have looked like this \frac{3^{-2}\left(a^2\right)^{-2}}{4^{-2}\times b^{-2}}x\frac{\frac{1}{4^3}}{\frac{1}{a^3}} They made the error right off the bat, they may have made this error due to not knowing what proper rule to start off with. I have made the same type of mistakes! In doing so the rest of the work is wrong, and the answer is wrong. The correct answer is: \frac{b^2}{36a}. [name]

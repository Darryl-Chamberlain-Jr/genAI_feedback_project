Human-induced environmental damage inadvertently instigates conflict and transnational crime, leading to national security concerns (Bergenas & Knight, 2015). As Harris (2013) states, humans are at the center of climate change and are a root cause of pollution and its adverse repercussions. When humans engage in deforestation, agriculture, industrial processes, and burning fossil fuels, greenhouse gases are released into the atmosphere, leading to global warming (Harris, 2013). Subsequently, transformations occur in weather patterns, creating extreme temperatures, drought, flooding, and changes in water levels (Harris, 2013). Debilitating widespread socio-economic disruption, a decline in physical well-being, and impairment of ecologic environments are prevalent (Harris, 2013). Climate change produces floods and droughts, affects food and water security, causes illnesses, and triggers climate-induced displacement (Harris, 2013). Disputes over resources driven by deforestation or water insecurity incite violence and illicit trade (Bergenas & Knight, 2015). This can be seen in the case of Syria, which experienced a civil war partly due to a severe drought (Kelley et al., 2015). Kelley et al. (2015) suggest that human activities, such as climate change, increased the likelihood of drought and caused it to be more serious (Kelley et al., 2015). The drying trend in Syria, along with rising temperatures and sea-level pressure, is consistent with the effects of greenhouse gas emissions (Kelley et al., 2015). Tensions arose over water scarcity, which significantly escalated the Syrian conflict (Kelley et al., 2015). Environmental degradation exacerbates political and economic instability, triggering social unrest and economic downturns, especially in regions dependent on natural resources (Bergenas & Knight, 2015). Such instability breeds extremist groups and organized crime, threatening global security and U.S. interests (Bergenas & Knight, 2015). 2 Sustainable resource management, international cooperation, and U.S. diplomatic and military support are vital in mitigating these risks and addressing the cascading impacts of environmental degradation on stability and security worldwide (Bergenas & Knight, 2015). Bergenas and Knight (2015) state that the funds from the illegal trading of natural resources, including oil, timber, and charcoal, are used to support terrorist organizations and criminal groups. Notably, the Islamic State's primary revenue stream comes from unlawfully trading oil and other terrorist groups and transnational criminals, such as al-Shabaab in East Africa, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia in South America, and the Xaysavang network in Southeast Asia, also exploit natural resources to finance their activities (Bergenas & Knight, 2015). Environmental crime has global impacts on security, development, and conservation (Bergenas & Knight, 2015). Environmental crime, valued at $200 billion annually, poses severe threats to national and international security, necessitating collaborative efforts from governments, nongovernmental organizations, and businesses to address the issue comprehensively (Bergenas & Knight, 2015). Historically, addressing this crime has been mainly left to environmental groups, facing competition from bureaucratic and nongovernmental organizations (Bergenas & Knight, 2015). Governments struggle with enforcement due to corruption and resource constraints (Bergenas & Knight, 2015). Additionally, drug violence and trafficking are interdependent on supply and demand regardless of efforts to break the cycle (TED, 2013). Unfortunately, the demand for illegal drugs remains, and consumers and policymakers exacerbate situations, escalating tensions, violence, and criminal activity (TED, 2013). Organized crime involving natural resources impacts various aspects of society, including economics, governance, and public health, urging for a reevaluation of policies and regulations to address these challenges (TED, 2009). Overall, the intricate 3 relationship between human activities and environmental factors is complex, with one exacerbating the other in a vicious cycle. 4 References Bergenas, J., & Knight, A.

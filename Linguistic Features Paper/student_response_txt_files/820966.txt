The demand for reliable, effective, and secure power sources is a major energy policy concern as national security systems increasingly use electricity. This dependency presents homeland security issues for the US and its allies, especially in terms of disruption risk and energy infrastructure security. Energy Infrastructure Reliability and National Security  National security relies on reliable electricity. Any grid breakdown might compromise defense, intelligence, and crisis response. "Grid reliability governance suffers from excessive privatization. The authority responsible for writing and enforcing grid reliability standards, North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC), is a private membership organization" (Klass et al., 2024).  The continuity and security of the power supply needed for national activities may be compromised by commercial profits and national security needs. Energy system resilience means it can quickly recover from interruptions. Even in emergencies, national security systems must work. A policy must promote physical protection and redundancy devices like microgrids and battery storage to maintain operations during grid failures. Energy infrastructure may be attacked to weaken national security; therefore, its security is vital. Energy plans must involve strong cyber and physical security. The Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) is crucial: "EERE stakeholders will be empowered to more readily detect, respond to, and recover from evolving cyber threats and vulnerabilities. The strategy will also facilitate more engagement with industry, academia, and other government offices to ensure EERE’s early-stage research meets its goals without duplicating efforts" (U.S. Department of Energy, 2020). To improve grid security, collaboration is needed. Reduced energy over-reliance improves security and economics: "Energy independence will trickle down to the clean energy supply chain, increasing national security, when materials and components are sourced domestically. In turn, this will support U.S. economic growth and prosperity" (U.S. Department of Energy, n.d). Our policy protects the energy supply chain from external threats and boosts the U.S. economy. Conclusion National security depends on power; thus, reliable, resilient, and secure regulations are needed. Addressing these issues can reduce the dangers of energy over-reliance and strengthen national security operations against evolving threats. Reference: Klass, A., Macey, J., Welton, S., & Wiseman, H.

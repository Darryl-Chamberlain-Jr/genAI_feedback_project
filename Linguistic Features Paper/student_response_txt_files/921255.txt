"When it comes to privacy while being online, there are several precautions that you can take. Considering public networks are just that, public. This means that anyone can use them and you have no idea what their intentions are or what viruses that network could give your device. For one, I use McAfee which is anti-virus software to help protect from random scams, hackers and viruses that could easily be downloaded onto my computer without any intention. Another precaution that I take is having a secure VPN. This allows me to have privacy when connected to a public network, hides my IP address, and encrypts my data traffic. A few other minor and basic precautions that I take are to be cautious of what I am downloading onto my devices and continuously updating them as well to keep the highest security standards downloaded. It is also smart to have passwords on all of your devices that are different and not so easy to guess." That's a great point with having two factor identification when logging onto certain devices or websites! Most logins on more secure sites have the option for two verification methods these days. I also think it is super helpful to be able to control your WiFi from your phone or an application. It makes it easy to add, delete people, and share the WiFi with the click of a button. "I completely agree that apps most likely ask for way more than they would need access to. Most of it we aren't probably even aware that they have access to anyways. Good point! There are constantly leaks of passwords and people's information being stolen via the internet. It is always a good practice to protect as much of our information as we can."

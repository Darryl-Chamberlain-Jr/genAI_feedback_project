Human security is a complex and interconnected set of ideas, and many components of human security are required for people to be safe and prosperous. Perhaps the most foundational aspect of human security is food security: the assured access to nutritious and ample food. To achieve this goal of food security, all people need to have both economic and physical access to food (United Nations Development Programme, 1994, p27.). The world produces enough food to feed everyone, but there is unequal distribution of food throughout the globe, and over 780 million people face chronic hunger today (World Food Programme, n.d.). Food insecurity leads to the stunting of children, shorter lifespans, worse quality of life overall, and extreme food insecurity can lead to deadly famines (Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations, 2021). There are many reasons for food insecurity: conflict, drought or poor economic conditions can all cause people to lose access to food. For example, there is a history of food insecurity in Nepal due to bad economic conditions in the traditionally agrarian country (Gartaula et al., 2017). Today, small farms are rarely profitable, and many are unable to sell their crops for high enough prices to sustain production. One interviewee stated that “We have to make a living in any way possible. Production from agriculture is not enough” (Gartaula et al., 2017). In order to make enough money, the interviewee is forced to migrate to other countries for profitable work. Another common trend in Nepal is for farmers to become sharecroppers in order to make ends meet, and they never become landowners (Gartaula et al., 2017). This is a nefarious cycle, since more farmers are giving up on landownership or full-time farming, while taking jobs far away from their family. In the long term, this reduction in farming will make Nepal more reliant on food imports, and farming will not be as sustainable since sharecroppers and absentee landlords do not care about the health of the land that they use. This negative situation is due to secondary effects of food insecurity: people would stay close to family and not be migrant workers or sharecroppers if they could afford to do so.  However, there are ways to make farming more profitable in Nepal, allowing food security to improve over time. One large success is the High Value Agriculture Project (HVAP) run by the International fund for Agricultural Development and the Government of Nepal. HVAP is a program which was implemented in rural Nepal from 2011-2018, aiming at connecting small farmers with better food buyers (Kashi et al., 2018). These farmers had government support and connections which allowed them to sell to a wider variety of wholesalers or grocery stores who may have been unavailable before. Due to this intervention, farmers reached more buyers than ever before, and income went up by 36% over the seven-year period. HVAP participants were also less likely to be living in poverty when compared to farmers without access to the program (Kashi et al., 2018). Overall, HVAP proved to be a successful intervention, and made food security better because more farmers were able to sell their food for sustainable prices. From a food security perspective, it is healthier when Nepal is more independent of food imports, and it is beneficial when small farmers can make a profit without a second job or sharecropping. Other countries should look at HVAP, and take steps to implement a similar program. HVAP proves that small farmers can be economically productive while also improving food security, but they require support from the government. Governments should do everything in their power to improve food distribution while also minimizing the amount of poverty within agriculture.

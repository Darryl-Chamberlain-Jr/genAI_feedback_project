"Class, When it comes to internet privacy I choose to take a simpler route. I really just don't put my personal business out on the internet. I started using social media back in 2008 but really only used it regularly for about 4 years. Once I was out of high school I realized that I just didn't care about other friends business and if I did I would ask. Since my information is on the internet somewhere I really just insure I try not to accept cookies and regularly go through my email and unsubscribe from any spam. So far I really feel comfortable with just using the internet less to prevent my privacy from being targeted. When it comes to security I used to be more in tune with my electronic devices and insuring I was caught up with he latest virus protection. As I got older I really started using the internet differently and really 90% of my internet activity comes from my smart phone. I don't play games on my phone and I'm not really downloading anything other than email attachments that I would send myself. I take a really simplistic approach to internet security now but that is primarily because I feel like my internet activity is simplistic. I regularly check my bank accounts so I also know if my money is being taken. I did have an instance where a credit card that I never use ever had a tiny charge. I was able to rectify the issue and I was able to remove my cards from being used again on the website they had been used on. In this case my simple approach worked and have worked for my since but I do think I am fortunate with what has happened with me and my experience. I approach internet security how I would in the physical world really. I mind my own business and if it looks like a sketchy place then I will go somewhere else." "you are so much more thorough with your security. What is more impressive is that what you do does not go above and beyond but creating small habits that add to your overall enhanced security. Something we both have in common is using VPN's. I did purchase a VPN for a year but I found that I wasn't using it as much as I thought I would. Most of the time I don't like using public Wi-Fi. I don't come into many situations where my unlimited cellular data gets throttled to a point where I can't download or stream something on my phone. If you do know some good VPN's that are free send them my way!"

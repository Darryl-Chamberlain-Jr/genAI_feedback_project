Human activities that have led to environmental degradation have increased the threat of transnational crime, which presents challenges to US national security interests. The illegal practices of illegal logging, illegal fishing, and climate-induced displacement are among the primary drivers of this issue. Illegal logging leads to deforestation, biodiversity loss, and habitat destruction while providing funding for transnational criminal networks engaged in timber trafficking (Bergenas & Knight, 2015). Similarly, illegal fishing hampers marine ecosystems, threatens food security, and leads to exploitation by organized crime syndicates, which take advantage of regulatory gaps (Bergenas & Knight, 2015). Moreover, climate change-induced events, such as extreme weather events and rising sea levels, make populations susceptible to displacement and creates opportunities for exploitation by criminal networks (Harris, 2013). These environmental crimes directly impact US national security interests by destabilizing regions essential to US interests, undermining stability, worsening conflicts, and challenging law enforcement efforts. For example, the illicit trade in timber and the exploitation of natural resources may fund criminal organizations that engage in other illicit activities, potentially destabilizing regions critical to US interests (Bergenas & Knight, 2015). Furthermore, illegal fishing operations can escalate tensions over maritime resources, bringing challenges to maritime security interests leading to increased surveillance and law enforcement efforts. Climate-induced displacement adds to humanitarian crises, increasing strain on resources and bringing the need for increased border security and immigration policies. (Harris, 2013; Canales, 2013). Explain the destabilizing influences that result from resource-based conflict. Competition over natural resources such as timber, minerals, or water often leads to resource-based conflicts that can destabilize a region (Bergenas & Knight, 2015). For example, illegal logging operations can fuel organized crime and undermine local governance, which can contribute to social tensions and violence. When natural resources are scarce, like in areas affected by drought or water scarcity, conflicts may intensify as communities compete for access to essential resources (Kelley et al., 2015). These conflicts can cause internal displacement, refugee crises, and humanitarian emergencies, which can disrupt social cohesion and exacerbate existing political and ethnic tensions. Identify the growing role that the natural environment plays in contributing to or causing political and /or economic destabilization within a country or within a region. According to Harris (2013), the natural environment is increasingly becoming a cause of political and economic instability across countries and regions. This is mainly due to climate change, environmental degradation, and resource scarcity. Extreme weather conditions caused by climate change, like droughts, floods, and hurricanes, can severely affect agriculture and lead to food shortages, economic hardship, and mass migration. Countries with weak governance structures or limited resources to tackle environmental issues, like in Africa or Southeast Asia, can face more challenges and cause political unrest. Moreover, environmental degradation, such as pollution and deforestation, can impede economic development, increase poverty, contribute to social inequality, and lead to instability. Analyze how political or economic destabilization can lead to security concerns for the U.S. According to Glenny (2009), political or economic instability in regions impacted by resource-based conflicts or environmental challenges can present security concerns for the United States. This is because such instability can result in the emergence of failed states or ungoverned territories, which can become safe havens for terrorist organizations or criminal networks to operate. These groups may exploit the instability to recruit members, plan attacks, or traffic illicit goods, which can directly threaten U.S. national security interests. Additionally, refugee flows resulting from conflicts or environmental disasters can strain neighboring countries' resources and destabilize entire regions, potentially leading to regional instability. This may require US humanitarian assistance or military intervention to address security threats and protect stability. Furthermore, political or economic instability can disrupt global markets, impacting trade, investment, and energy security. This can have a negative effect on U.S. economic interests and may require diplomatic or military efforts to stabilize affected regions and protect US strategic interests.

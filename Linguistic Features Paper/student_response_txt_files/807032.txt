"There is a lot of information that some apps request, but I feel like we shouldn’t have to share half of what they ask for. As someone who takes privacy seriously, I always Enable two-factor authentication(2FA). This feature allows me to not only use a strong password but also sends me a notification to my phone /email to verify if it’s me trying to log in. Another way to go about online privacy is to always make sure you update your software updates a lot of times these updates have built-in firewalls that protect your information while on the web. Privacy is important in today's world where everything is becoming so tech savvy, we must do our best to keep our personal information off the web. Hackers and other scammers will have a field day if you don’t protect your information. There are a lot of steps you can take to protect your information the best part about it all is all in your hands so the next time you are on the web keep in mind that protecting yourself should be your number one priority." "[name], I couldn't agree with you more , yes as we know posting anything on the web becomes public information. and its very smart of you to have many emails so that you can use depending on the importance level of the website. Many different passwords? How do you remember all of them, i have trouble remembering my school password lol" "[name], I stand with you when you say a lot of spams comes from chickling on unknow website or links to random things . Also yes apple does put a lot into there security feature but i think maybe trying a VPN wouldn't hurt only because there might be a point in time where apples firewalls might crash and people personal data might get leaked ."

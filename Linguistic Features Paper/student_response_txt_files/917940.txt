"Hello Class, My security and privacy online varies between which device I'm using and where I am using it. When using my home PC like I am now making this I rely on the built in security features and free online scans of my system occasionally to make sure my system isn't compromised. To this point I have not yet had it become compromised because I am very careful of links and sites that I visit and everything that I download. When using my phone away from home or work I use a downloaded VPN app, in the case that I need to connect to a public network the VPN will protect me against most basic attacks on my data. I also use a VPN on my laptop whenever I am at a coffee shop or when on an airline flight connected to the in-flight WIFI. After learning about the different ways that networks can be compromised and how easy it is to attack someone's data I will definitely be looking into more/ better ways to protect myself online." "[name], I have felt the pain of trying to buy airline tickets or book hotels before and the next time you search them up even day later the prices have drastically increased. Most recently I have had a ton of targeted ads about footwear that I've never searched for but only talked about when my devices were around. The craziest example I have of this is that I used to live in North Carolina and I loved Zaxby's, when i moved back to California I explained the chain to them and received an ad for Zaxby's that night (the closest one was over 2k miles away)." "2-factor authentication has become a safety stapple for online security in the past couple of year. I honestly didn't like it before because I felt it was always too time consuming to setup. However now with the authenticator applications and after I had my Venmo account compromised I went back and set it up on all applicable websites and apps."

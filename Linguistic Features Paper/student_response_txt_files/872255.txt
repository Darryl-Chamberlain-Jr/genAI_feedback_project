Human activities such as deforestation and habitat destruction contribute to climate change, fostering transnational crime (Bergenas & Knight, 2015). Illegal logging and land encroachment associated with deforestation lead to crimes like illegal wildlife trade and resource conflicts. This strain on ecosystems, along with transnational crimes, can heighten regional instability and impact U.S. national security interests. Resource-based conflicts, often linked to environmental degradation, can worsen destabilization, as vulnerable nations face the risk of becoming stateless due to climate change (Harris, 2013, p. 135). Environmental strain contributes to potential conflicts over scarce resources, threatening security and stability. Illegal activities, such as land encroachment and resource exploitation, associated with these conflicts, may lead to transnational crimes, creating additional challenges for regional stability. Similarly, pollution and over-exploitation of natural resources result in environmental degradation and loss of biodiversity. Illicit activities such as illegal dumping and unregulated resource extraction also present challenges, like illegal fishing and organized crime involvement (Bergenas & Knight, 2015). The associated environmental degradation can trigger social unrest, migration, and resource-related conflicts, which can affet geopolitical stability and U.S. national security, especially in strategically significant regions. The growing role of the natural environment in political and economic destabilization is obvious, as climate change impacts millions of people. Even people far from pollution sources face continuous threats of conflict, institutional breakdown, migration, and resource-related crises (Harris, 2013, p. 122). This connection highlights how environmental issues contribute to political and economic instability within and across nations. Additionally, climate change-induced migration, a consequence of rising temperatures and extreme weather events, creates vulnerable populations that are susceptible to transnational crimes like human trafficking. Competition for declining resources may worsen tensions and conflicts, straining border security and leading to humanitarian crises with implications for U.S. national security. The impact of climate change on the U.S. is highlighted by Kelley et al. (2015), who point out the connected path from human interference with climate to severe drought, agricultural collapse, and mass human migration, with implications for conflicts. Their thesis connecting drought to the conflict in Syria supports the link between climate and conflict (Kelley et al., 2015). Addressing these environmental issues is important for mitigating their impact on transnational crime and safeguarding national security interests. Political and economic destabilization resulting from environmental challenges have direct implications for U.S. security. The International Council on Human Rights Policy stresses that climate change is already undermining various internationally protected human rights, including health, life, food, water, and personal security in conflict (Harris, 2013, p. 125; Bergenas & Knight, 2015). The potential for conflicts, mass migrations, and resource scarcity cause security concerns for the U.S.. It requires strategic considerations and international cooperation to address the broader implications of environmental destabilization on human rights and security.

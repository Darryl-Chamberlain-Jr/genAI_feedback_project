	As a society we have grown vastly more dependent on our electrical infrastructure. With this growth not only private, but in the defense sector, the strain on our power grid rises. One of the biggest concerns is how this dependency affects the national security system. Bases across the United States house not only weapons systems and vehicles they are also the home of thousands of soldiers, sailors, and airman. The effect of loss of power on these bases would not be immediate but prolonged loss of power would be detrimental (CNA, 2015).  	It is easy to consider the up-front challenges that are based off power for defense. Radars, counter missile defense, and communications are all items that would be taken out in the event of prolonged power loss. You also must think of the people that are required to run this equipment. Military operations have a huge support system not just consisting of active-duty personnel, there are also contractors and DOD civilians that support defense (CAN, 2015). In the event of power loss not just on the base but the surrounding cities people will have to decide to either come to work or stay home and take care of personal needs (Scott, 2016).  	When making energy policies the first question that is going to be asked is how it will affect our power grid. If transitioning to clean energy it will be difficult to issue energy policies that will not put a damper on current power requirements. Over reliance will result in homeland security assets because it is a target for our enemies. Knowing a country is very dependent on electricity with an older grid might lead to power stations being attacked. These attacks will cause power outages for thousands and lower military readiness (Scott, 2016).  References CNA Military Advisory Board. (2015). National security and assured U.S. electrical power.

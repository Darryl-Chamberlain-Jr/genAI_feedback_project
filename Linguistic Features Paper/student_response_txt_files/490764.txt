Dependence on Electricity is an unavoidable consequence of Homeland Security in the 21st Century. This reliance on electricity coupled with a lack of air-gapped power generation capability and poor electrical infrastructure throughout most of the United States is a severe handicap on the Homeland Security Enterprise. These challenges are not easily met and hamper our Nation’s ability to respond effectively to natural disasters and to collaborate with our allies in cases of extreme international events. Our National Security system is largely dependent on electricity due to the substantial computerized aspect. One of America’s largest national security threats is in the Cyber Security realm. Some of the more vital installations including those in the DC metropolitan area have some power generation capabilities, though mostly intended for short term emergencies, and powered by diesel. These backups are intended to maintain systems from data loss and allow key equipment to function. The United States has a heavy reliance on local power grids. In 2022, an attack on two substations by someone with a firearm disabled power to 100,000 residents in Moore County, North Carolina. (Zullo, 2022) During a recent exercise at Fort Bragg, North Carolina power was cut to the installation without warning to highlight deficiencies and establish “best practices.” The military in particular has recognized the risk that power interruption poses to installations. One of the major components of America’s Homeland Security Apparatus is the military, with the Cyber command being essential. Fort Bragg discovered that while they could conduct their deployment exercise without power, movement within the installation was substantially limited and their base hospital had to operate at reduced capacity. (Moore, 2019) These are issues that would only be compounded by a larger scale emergency, particularly one affecting more than the installation itself. America, both as a member of NATO as well as the “five-eyes” shares our intelligence product with our allies. Current energy limitations in the United States involve the purchase of energy products, particularly oil, from countries that are not within the best interests of the United States or its allies. Likewise, many allies are purchasing from countries that are averse to their own standing, such as Russia, despite current sanctions. When the United States sanctions Russia, nations allied with the United States are required to pick their battles. This energy reliance funds organizations that later fund terrorist groups that interfere with the goals of the United States and its allies. It is a vector of attack for both state and non-state actors, an easy link demonstrated by the 2022 attack in North Carolina. Despite the hardening of infrastructure that the FBI recommended, our infrastructure is geographically separated preventing effective, constant monitoring. The infrastructure is generally privately controlled, and each of those companies is responsible for setting their own security posture.

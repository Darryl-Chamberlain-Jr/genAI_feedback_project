	Our national security system's reliance on electricity could create a more challenging atmosphere regarding our energy policy.  In the larger picture, all of our defense systems inside the continental region rely on the same systems that supply electricity to our houses, farms, infrastructure, and businesses. (CNA Military Advisory Board, 2015)  Our bases, deployable assets like our ships and boats while in port, and communication systems all rely on this same grid. (CNA Military Advisory Board, 2015)  The volume of national security assets that require electricity could compound any effort to switch to green energy sources.  This could mean that any strategy to cut energy sources like coal, oil, and natural gas without supplying enough power via other means could reduce our defensive capabilities and potentially have an effect on the populace.   	When discussing an over-reliance on energy, examples of the effects can be seen in any natural disaster involving flooding, hurricanes, tornadoes, and fires. (Power Failure | Homeland Security, n.d.)  When power is lost, all electronic banking systems are unavailable, wireless devices cannot recharge, and cooking must be done over a fire.  When Hurricane Sandy hit the Northeastern coast of the U.S., it struck a region that was not used to preparing for the devastating force of a hurricane. (NYC, 2012; US Department of Commerce, n.d.)  While this happened, energy was cut for multiple days in major cities. (Electricity Restored to Many in the Northeast but Outages Persist - U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), n.d.)  During this time, many businesses, schools, stores, and apartments were without power for multiple days. (Electricity Restored to Many in the Northeast but Outages Persist - U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), n.d.; NYC, 2012)  From a Homeland Security perspective, this poses a risk where our naval assets are possibly moved to avoid potential damage, our air assets are relocated, and our land-based vehicles are transported or moved away from disaster zones. (CNA Military Advisory Board, 2015; Power Failure | Homeland Security, n.d.)  Our bases will be limited by the available defensive assets and personnel before, during, and for a short duration after a major conflict. (Hurricane Exercise/Citadel Gale, n.d.)  This can mean to our allies that they may not get assistance in the event of a major conflict.  It could also lead to trade being disrupted and cross-continental supply lines cut for a duration.  This could also result in our Forward Operating Bases (FOB) not getting the resources or information necessary to support their mission.  Resources: CNA Military Advisory Board. (2015).

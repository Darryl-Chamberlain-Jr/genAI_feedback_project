"I make it a priority to keep all my devices updated with the latest software and security patches, as staying updated helps close any vulnerabilities that might be exploited by hackers. Alongside regular updates, I use reputable antivirus software to safeguard against malware and ensure that I conduct regular scans. For login security, I create strong, unique passwords for each of my accounts and manage them through a password manager. This practice is complemented by enabling two-factor authentication wherever it’s available, adding an extra layer of security beyond just passwords. At home, I’ve customized my router settings away from the default to more secure configurations, including a unique username and password. I secure my Wi-Fi network with WPA3 encryption, the most robust available, and keep my router’s firewall enabled to monitor traffic. Additionally, I’ve set up a guest network for visitors to protect access to my main network. When online, I am very cautious about the personal information I share, particularly on social media platforms. I always ensure that the websites I visit use HTTPS, especially when I’m entering sensitive information. For added security, particularly in public or unsecured networks, I use a VPN to encrypt my data and obscure my IP address, safeguarding my online activities. Physically, I keep my devices secure and within sight, especially in public places, and use biometric locks and secure passcodes as extra safeguards. I also stay alert to my surroundings when accessing sensitive information to prevent "shoulder surfing." To stay ahead of potential threats, I regularly follow security blogs and websites to stay informed about the latest in cyber threats and how to protect against them." " I completely agree with your updated approach to online privacy. It's a common misconception that incognito mode offers complete privacy, but as you've discovered, it doesn’t protect against all forms of tracking. Your shift towards using a VPN is a smart move. It not only enhances your privacy but also opens up possibilities like accessing geo-restricted content, which is a great perk. Regarding your router settings, it’s definitely a good idea to change the default username and password to something more secure. Sometimes, these settings can be tricky to adjust, but reaching out to your provider for assistance can help secure your network effectively. It’s a small step that can make a big difference in your overall network security." It’s really understandable to feel a bit out of your depth when it comes to the nitty-gritty of home network security—many people share that sentiment. Using public Wi-Fi is often unavoidable, especially when traveling. It’s great to hear that you use a VPN on your laptop and desktop; even if initially for entertainment access, it inadvertently boosts your security by encrypting your internet connection. You’re already practicing some essential security habits, like avoiding random links and pop-ups, which are common vectors for malware and phishing attacks. Also, striving to use different passwords for different sites is a good practice, even if it's tough to maintain consistently. Maybe consider a password manager to help manage and generate strong passwords without the hassle of remembering each one!

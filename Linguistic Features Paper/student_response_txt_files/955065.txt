"I have a very cynical and pessimistic view on internet security and especially wifi security. Your digital footprint is forever and is impossible to entirely cover up. No matter how hard you work at concealing your identity online it's always possible to be found due to human error. So when browsing online I keep that in mind. When protecting my own information it depends on my location and where I am. When I travel OCONUS I avoid public wifi and rely on my phone carrier for internet while using a VPN unless I am at a family's house I will use their wifi still with a VPN. In CONUS I adopt the same idea. No public wifi and a VPN always. My home wifi password is randomly generated by bitwarden as well. All of that being said I am very cynical and pessimistic and still assume that my data can be viewed in someway" "[name], this is pretty much identical to what I do. I feel as if your judgement is what protects you the most when trying to protect your data online. I'm in the Coast Guard and I laugh at the yearly cyber awareness training we have because of how obvious some of the fake emails are, but I your online security is only as good as your judgement." "[name], The avoiding sketchy places really stuck out to me and it seems like such an obvious thing. Complacency kicks in when you're on your couch and distracted by life. That's where not putting everything online and monitoring bank accounts closely works really well."

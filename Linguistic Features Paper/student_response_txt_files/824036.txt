Module 8 Assignment: Food Security  Food Security Defined 	Food security is defined as a community’s ability to secure, supply, distribute, or source a healthy food system or construct for the citizens who reside within a community. Food security requires reliance on a series of factors, such as regional and international trade, weather and climate, and social developments, such as population increase and rise in criminal and extremist violence, for example.  Case Studies 	A study conducted on citizens of east coast Malaysia in the year 2012 focused on households who received low-income. In conclusion to the study, it was discovered that climate change serves as a primary driving factor for food insecurity within the region (Alam et al., 2018). Furthermore, by increasing efforts to educate citizens on the proper procedures for food storage, preservation and sourcing, these concepts can transform food insecurity at the household level and overtime, can contribute to linear food security throughout the community. While these findings were observed as beneficial for this community, further research is encouraged on the variables which were examined, in order to assert that this study offers solutions which can be applied universally, across various populations which hold a complex demographic make-up (Alam et al., 2018).   	A study conducted on citizens of Nepal between the years 1990 and 2013 focused on food security as a contributor to the social well-being of citizens. The study revealed that within the Kaski region of Nepal, agricultural sustainment, as a contributor to the region’s food security, is beginning to shift away from traditional norms and practices. As a result, this has caused local agricultural practices to slowly reduce, with reliance on non-local agricultural sustainment to take prominence (Chaudhary, 2016). Despite the reduction in local agriculture sustainment, food insecurity in the form of malnutrition decreased between the years 1990 and 2013. Despite the reduction in malnutrition amongst citizens, the concern lies in the region’s shrinking ability to locally sustain food security. Additionally, a contributing factor pertains to climate-driven events, such as monsoons (Chaudhary, 2016; Dixon & Richards, 2016). In response to the region’s decline in locally-sourced food security, recommendations to offer for this region include the need for local policymakers, who embody and value continued growth within the local agricultural landscape. A community’s agricultural landscape will remain a factor in assessing the health of the community’s food security efforts (Kołodziejczak & Pawlak, 2020). Organizational Impact: Food Security Impacts 	Food security challenges are addressed through concepts that focus on collaboration, strong social capital, and the economic development rate of a community (Kołodziejczak & Pawlak, 2020). Therefore, political security plays a role in influencing the health of a community’s food security.  Policy Recommendation  	The recommendation to provide towards strengthening food security requires the community’s political and environmental security to be aligned and in good standing. This allows for greater resilience to be present amongst environmental and political stressors that a community endures (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, 2021). For example, political security can contribute to a community’s food security by implementing collaborative efforts amongst local, regional, and international policymakers, as well as stakeholders and non-government organizations (NGOs). This allows innovation to pursue towards properly equipping communities with tools to combat food insecurity (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, 2021).  References Alam, M.

Food security is when everyone consistently has physical, social, and economic availability of enough safe and nutritious food, fulfilling their dietary requirements and preferences, to lead an active and healthy lifestyle. Such would include the consistent availability of food, adequate resources for individuals to obtain nutritious food, proper use of food considering essential nutrition and care, and stable access to food without risks from various shocks or events; however, the challenges associated with food insecurity are diverse and interconnected (United Nations Development Programme, 1994; Resilience, 2020; The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, 2021). Economic and agricultural issues, such as economic disparities, low per capita GDP, and inadequate agricultural infrastructure, lead to poor productivity and inefficiency in food systems. Environmental impacts are also significant, with intensive farming practices contributing to deforestation, greenhouse gas emissions, and biodiversity loss, which can negatively affect food production (Alam et al., 2018; Pawlak & Kołodziejczak, 2020). However, socioeconomic disparities result in uneven distribution and access to food resources, therefore exacerbating food insecurity among marginalized groups.  Nonetheless, developing countries particularly face technological gaps, often needing more resources to adopt sustainable farming technologies. Nevertheless, political, economic, and social factors, including governance issues and economic instability, further influence food security, as do infrastructural and demographic challenges, where poor infrastructure and changing population dynamics can impede effective food distribution (Gartaula et al., 2016; Pawlak & Kołodziejczak, 2020). Lastly, climatic changes and natural calamities are increasingly affecting food production and distribution, threatening the stability of food systems worldwide (Alam et al., 2018). With food security challenges manifesting differently across developing countries, from the physical unavailability of food to stark social inequalities impacting nutritional access, specific case studies, such as those in Malaysia's East Coast Economic Region (ECER) and Nepal's rural landscape, underscore these regional variations. ECER focuses on enhancing resilience and adaptation practices among vulnerable populations to combat food insecurity, including addressing challenges such as climate change vulnerability and dependence on food imports (Alam et al., 2018). Similarly, in Nepal, the study adopts a unique "food wellbeing" approach that intertwines aspects of food security, sovereignty, and social wellbeing, particularly in the context of changes in traditional agricultural roles due to male out-migration and the increasing vulnerability of agriculture to climatic changes (Gartaula et al., 2016). These case studies highlight the complex and diverse food security challenges and the importance of tailored responses to address different regions' specific needs and conditions. It is crucial to note that numerous factors influence food security and insecurity globally. Agricultural performance, especially the efficiency and sustainability of farming practices, with sustainable farming methods, helps ensure a steady food supply. Economic development represents another key driver, with income levels, GDP, and overall economic growth significantly impacting the ability of individuals and nations to secure food. Additionally, trade policies, especially those promoting open trade, can enhance food security by facilitating the import of essential food items, thereby supplementing domestic production (Pawlak & Kołodziejczak, 2020). Lastly, environmental and technological factors play an instrumental role in adopting sustainable practices to help preserve essential natural resources. At the same time, advanced technologies in agriculture can increase production efficiency and yield, thereby bolstering food security. These interlinked factors underscore the multifaceted nature of food security challenges and the need for integrated strategies to address them effectively (United Nations Development Programme, 1994, p.27; Alam et al., 2018; Pawlak & Kołodziejczak, 2020; Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, 2021). The impact of interventions addressing food security varies significantly at various levels of governance. The international level focuses primarily on providing development assistance that targets the root causes of food insecurity. This approach involves global organizations working collaboratively to offer aid and support, especially in crises. Nationally, governments play a crucial role by implementing policies tailored to their specific agricultural and economic conditions, ranging from subsidies for farmers to comprehensive food distribution programs and nutrition education. Local initiatives are also vital in enhancing food security. Efforts at the community level often include improving agricultural infrastructure, promoting education related to farming and food production, and facilitating the transfer of technology. These local endeavors are essential in building community capacities to achieve self-sufficiency and resilience in food production and distribution (Alam et al., 2018; Pawlak & Kołodziejczak, 2020). Various policy recommendations have been proposed to effectively address the multifaceted challenges of food insecurity, each targeting several aspects of the food system, prioritizing adopting environmentally friendly technologies and practices to ensure long-term agricultural sustainability, as the FAO (2021) advocates. Therefore, improving crucial elements such as irrigation systems, storage facilities, and transportation networks is pivotal for efficient food production and distribution (Pawlak & Kołodziejczak, 2020); implementing measures to alleviate poverty and improve income distribution is critical for bettering access to nutritious food, as noted by the UNDP (1994, p.27), encouraging the sharing of advanced agricultural technologies between developed and developing countries can help bridge technological gaps (Pawlak & Kołodziejczak, 2020). Enhancing global partnerships to address the complex food security issues (FAO, 2021), strengthening the role of NGOs, government agencies, and community organizations in food security initiatives is crucial (Resilience, 2020), developing strategies to tackle the long-term impacts of climate change on food production, including nutritional challenges, is necessary (Gartaula et al., 2016), investing in health, social protection, and education to build resilience among susceptible populations is essential (Gartaula et al., 2016), boosting local food production to increase self-sufficiency and reduce reliance on food imports is a significant step (Pawlak & Kołodziejczak, 2020), modifying methods to maintain nutrition levels and hygiene standards is important (Resilience, 2020), and allocating resources towards developing climate-resistant crops and livestock is a forward-thinking strategy (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, 2021). Food security emerges as a complex issue influenced by a myriad of factors, including socioeconomic, environmental, and technological aspects, as well as the challenges of economic and agricultural inefficiencies, ecological degradation, socioeconomic disparities, and the impact of climate change. Addressing these challenges calls for multi-level governance efforts, encompassing local initiatives for agricultural infrastructure enhancement, tailored national policies, and international support, with policy recommendations focused on sustainable agricultural investment, infrastructure improvement, economic policy strengthening, technological transfer, and international collaboration alongside emphasizing the roles of NGOs, government agencies, community groups, climate change mitigation, empowering vulnerable populations, reducing import dependency, adapting food processing and storage techniques, and prioritizing research and development. A holistic approach, integrating immediate relief with long-term strategic planning and community engagement, is essential for achieving global food security and fostering a healthy, sustainable food system for future generations (United Nations Development Programme, 1994; Gartaula et al., 2016; Alam et al., 2018; Resilience, 2020; Pawlak & Kołodziejczak, 2020; Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, 2021).

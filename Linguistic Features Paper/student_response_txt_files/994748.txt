 There have been numerous legal tools and mechanisms employed in an attempt to resolve the ongoing conflict in Israel-Palestine. Some of the laws that are applicable at the most tactile level of the conflict involve alleged war crimes committed by both factions and the Geneva Convention. On 7 October, the Palestinian armed group Hamas launched thousands of rockets into Israel and breached through the perimeter fence of Gaza. While doing so, the terror group killed and captured hundreds of Israeli civilians and military forces (UN, 2023). Many of us have seen media footage or read the stories of Hamas fighters infiltrating Israel via paragliders and murdering or kidnapping unarmed civilians at a music concert. In retaliation to the attacks, the Israeli military declared a state of war and began striking at targets in the Gaza Strip, including residential buildings and healthcare facilities (UN, 2023). Since the recent regional uptick in violence has begun, there have been thousands of people killed, and more than one million people have been displaced (UN, 2023). Many areas of Gaza have been decimated and are practically uninhabitable. Between 7 and 12 October 2023, Israeli forces conducted air bombardments, which devastated entire neighborhoods and, in some areas, killed entire families (Amnesty International, 2023). In cases like this, Israeli attacks violated international humanitarian law, most notably by failing to take feasible precautions to spare civilians. An overarching theme of conflicts internationally is jus in bello or the laws of war—the rules commonly referred to today as the law of armed conflict (LOAC) or international humanitarian law (Pohlman, 2019). Both belligerents have struggled militarily and diplomatically to target and attack righteous targets. Per the LOAC, the distinction between civilians and combatants is critical for ‘just war’. “Combatants can be targeted based on their status as combatants, while civilians are only targetable based on their conduct, that is, if they “directly participate in hostilities”, (Pohlman, 2019). Israel specifically has been under immense scrutiny due to the amount of civilian casualties in the Gaza Strip. The conflict in Israel-Palestine is a suitable example of when a law-abiding state actor is confronted with hybrid warfare tactics (i.e. the use of proxy forces, combined kinetic and non-kinetic attacks, guerilla warfare, etc.) When a law-abiding state is faced with an unethical and asymmetrical national threat, they are essentially pigeonholed/legally required to operate under compliance with the rule of law and public morality (Mosquera et. al., 2019).  Another key legal aspect of this conflict pertains to the recently extended cease-fire between Israel and Hamas (Goldenberg, et. al., 2023). In brief summary, the recent 4-day ceasefire was initiated on 23 November, but was extended multiple days following a mutually agreed desire to continue in the exchange of Israeli hostages for Hamas-affiliated prisoners. The negotiations for this event originated from mediation efforts facilitated by the U.S., Israel, Palestine, and the government of Qatar. The achievement of this ceasefire relied heavily on the prenegotiation of a peace process, often termed “talks about talks (Yeini, 2020). This dialogue typically involves how to get everyone to the negotiating table with an agreed-upon agenda. If continued peace talks and hostage/prisoner exchanges increase in frequency, there is the possibility for more sustainable peace negotiations. The impactful damage caused to both parties will undoubtedly leave a lasting impression and legacy of violence that must be addressed via retribution reconciliation or both (Cox & Van Nostrand, 2022).

Hi [name], The means by which Israel attacks and defends against Hamas is a highly contentious topic throughout the international community. Unlike Hamas, Israel undoubtedly faces a moral dilemma when adhering to the laws of armed conflict because the targeting methodology for the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) strictly forbids them from intentionally targeting civilians (Merriam, 2023). Israel is not a member of the 1977 Additional Protocol I (AP I) to the 1949 Geneva Conventions that outlined treaty-based targeting rules for member parties. This could serve as a benefit by allowing IDF troops to launch attacks without being hindered by overly strict rules of engagement. However, the IDF’s targeting rules still parallel those customary in international law (Merriam, 2023). In contrast, as you mentioned, Hamas has been known to hide amongst and below civilian populations and infrastructure while conducting military operations (NATO, 2014). There is a strategic logic behind Hamas’ use of human shields. The first of two components is based on the awareness of Israel’s desire to mitigate collateral damage/civilian casualties. Hamas has a powerful weapon in the form of leveraging international law against Israel. This is commonly referred to as lawfare. The term “lawfare” has no actual fixed definition but has come to be generally understood as the“use or misuse of law as a substitute for traditional military means to achieve military objectives (Stephens, 2011). If the IDF uses lethal force and causes an increase in civilian casualties, Hamas can and has used these events as an instrument of lawfare (NATO, 2014). Hamas would be in a position to accuse Israel of committing war crimes, which could result in the imposition of sanctions on Israel and lessened backing from Western states (NATO, 2014). The podcast below provided a phenomenal insight into the lessons learned so far in Israel’s fight against Hamas. Here, a former Commander of U.S. Central Command General Votel and Dr. Cohen, Director of RAND's Strategy and Doctrine Program discuss intricacies related to the current conflict. I’m hesitant to delve into specific tactics that can or should be employed by Israel and its allies. Unfortunately, it is safe to assume that Israel’s pursuit of Hamas in the Gaza Strip and opposition throughout the region will be marked by the use of subterranean warfare, urban fighting, high amounts of collateral damage, and potentially increased foreign engagement.

I appreciate your in-depth review of the legal considerations involving Lebanon's conflicts with neighboring states/factions. An aspect of your research that piqued my interest was the 2022 maritime boundary agreement that Israel and Lebanon reached in October of last year. The Israel–Lebanon Maritime Boundary Agreement was the product of more than ten years of negotiations across three administrations: Israel, Lebanon and the United States (United States Institute of Peace [USIP], 2023).
At its core, the agreement creates economic and energy development opportunities between both nations and, with an optimistic mindset, could offer a channel for further healing for the previous hostile countries. The agreement has proven to be an admirable example of conflict resolution, proving that practical, mutually beneficial agreements are more desirable over long-term hostilities (USIP, 2023). I also applaud your pointing out that this agreement could grow into land-border relations between the two countries. I listened to some of the below podcast with Amos Hochstein as the guest speaker. Amos was the primary mediator of the Israel-Lebanon agreement and is currently the U.S. special presidential coordinator for global infrastructure and energy security. Sometimes, I think nations are more likely to agree upon economics and energy before reaching agreements based on ideologies or religion.

I appreciate your detailed review of the humanitarian law agreements surrounding the 2023 Israel-Hamas War. A myriad of nuances are involved in this conflict's tactical, operational, and strategic levels, and for me to propose a single best strategy would be ineffective. The strategic approach for future Israeli operations should prioritize a.) effectively engaging Hamas combatants and civilians in direct support of military operations, b.) minimizing casualties on both sides of the conflict (civilian and combatant), and c.) denying Hamas logistically. Hamas fighters would be in a tight spot if they were completely cut off from receiving intelligence updates, fuel, food/water, medical supplies, etc. In short, the most beneficial strategy for either side to pursue should be reconciliation via mediation between Hamas and Israeli leaders in Doha, Qatar.
The military tactics can be as high-paced and precise as the IDF wants, but at the end of the day, military operations do very little to quell ideological motivations. 

The podcast below had a great segment where this conflict's' end state was discussed. The two guests also delved into specifics I wish I could effectively summarize here before midnight EST.

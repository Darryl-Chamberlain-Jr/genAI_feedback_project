In question five, the student made multiple errors that led to the wrong answer. The student mixed up a couple of steps with exponents: First, the student combined the bases too early instead of applying the exponents to each term independently. Also, they added the exponents (-2 and -3) together, but that's only correct when you're multiplying terms with the same base. After handling the exponents separately, you have to multiply or divide the bases, and then you can group like terms. The student got the negative exponent part right about flipping the base, but they should've applied it after sorting out the base correctly first. Simplify \left(\frac{3a^2}{4b}\right)^{-2}\cdot\left(\frac{4}{a}\right)^{-3} <span>First, apply the exponents to each term: </span> \left(\frac{3a^2}{4b}\right)^{-2}=\left(\frac{4b}{3a^2}\right)^2 \left(\frac{4}{a}\right)^{-3}=\left(\frac{a}{4}\right)^3 <span>Now, multiply the two terms: </span> <span>\left(\frac{4b}{3a^2}\right)^2\cdot\left(\frac{a}{4}\right)^3=\left(\frac{4b}{3a^2}\right)^2\cdot\left(\frac{a^3}{4^3}\right)</span> <span>Simplify the expression by multiplying the terms: </span> <span>\left(\frac{4b}{3a^2}\right)^2\cdot\left(\frac{a^3}{4^3}\right)=\left(\frac{16b^2}{9a^4}\right)\cdot\left(\frac{a^3}{64}\right)</span> <span>Combine the terms: </span> <span>\left(\frac{16b^2}{9a^4}\right)\cdot\left(\frac{a^3}{64}\right)=\frac{16b^2\cdot a^3}{9a^4\cdot64}</span> <span>Simplify the fraction by canceling out a^3 from the numerator and denominator: </span> \frac{16b^2\cdot a^3}{9a^4\cdot64}=\frac{16b^2}{9a\cdot64} Finally, simplify the constants: \frac{16b^2}{9a\cdot64}=\frac{b^2}{9a\cdot4}=\frac{b^2}{36a}

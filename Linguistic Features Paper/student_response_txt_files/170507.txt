Here is the next student submission: What was the most surprising thing you learned in this module? I really enjoyed this module as we are now studying our current era in Communication Technology and this is where the nuts and bolts of my future work is. I am pursuing a degree in Technical Management with a Minor in Communication and am working to become a Technical Writer in the Aerospace field as well as own my own Aerospace company. In the readings section for this module I chose the Remix and Authorship track as this is the most relevant to me. In the readings I think I found the most surprising thing in the entire module and that is that an Author or Artist is allowed to remix other Author's or Artist's work in remixing. I would think that this would be against copyright laws but it apparently is not. Which example of communication technology covered in this module is the most significant to human history, in your opinion? Why? I think the most significant Communication Technology covered in this module is the Internet. The reason I think this technology is the most significant in human history is that the Internet has made leaps and bounds in the ability of people to communicate over long distances with not just audio but more important visual. It is also revolutionary in the sense that going beyond television it allows individuals to communicate freely with each other. Do most digital communication technologies represent something entirely new, or are they more or less reimagined versions of their analog predecessors? Why do you think so? I think that digital communication technologies are something entirely new in that they allow components to be much smaller and compact than their analog predecessors. This ability to be more compact lets them travel freely with the user where as the older analog technologies were not very portable. This portability means that the technology can be easily and readily a part of the everyday life of users. What questions have been left unanswered for you in this module, and how might you continue your search for those answers? One of the questions I have left unanswered for me in this module is exactly how AI works. I know that it all gets down to programming but I would like to know how to do that. I am going to be in the future learning and taking courses on the technology of AI and programming. REFERENCES Everything is a Remix Part 1 (2021), by Kirby Ferguson (23:17/YouTube)

"Protecting privacy online involves a combination of strategies, including using secure passwords, enabling two-factor authentication where possible, being cautious about what information you share online, using encryption tools like VPNs, and regularly updating software to patch security vulnerabilities. Safeguarding your computer and devices involves installing reputable antivirus and antimalware software, keeping your operating system and applications up to date with the latest security patches, using a firewall to monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic, and being cautious about clicking on links or downloading attachments from unknown sources. So, to know if you need a good software, it's really up to the user to decide if you want to buy antivirus software or go with the free download that laptops also come with but you're putting yourself and your computer at risk if you don't keep up to date with the updates. In my opinion a good software to go with is Norton. This is a software you have to pay for that ranges from 29.99 to 99.99 which the difference is that the cheapest one only protects your own computer, and it limits the storage on your computer unlike the others that have more storage and can backup multiple computers. If you go with the one your computer uses, then in reality you're trusting that your computer antivirus software is good enough to do the job. At home I have AT&T Fiber for my router and for security i have a passcode to use the Wi-Fi and i can also monitor everything being used on an app on my phone called Smrt home manager which allows me to see what devices are connected and if I want to disable the devices from using the Wi-Fi in my home." "Good evening Eli, I agree with your discussion when it comes to never putting additional information about you because all it takes is someone to get any personal information and use it especially if you have it where you use hints if you forgot your password on any of your devices. " "I really enjoyed your discussion because I like how you use the example of the two-factor authentication because it's a very good practice to have with your passwords in case someone obtains that information but can't get any further without either using their face id or any other extra security before accessing the personal devices, so overall very good point on this discussion."

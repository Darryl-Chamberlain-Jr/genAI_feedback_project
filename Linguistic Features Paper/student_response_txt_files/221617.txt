Here is the next student submission: This module was an interesting one for sure. I really liked the video about the "remixes" in the reading portion. I had no idea Led Zepplin basically stole all of their material from other people. I mean I meant to say "remixed" their material. I do have to give it to Led Zepplin, they knew what was cool and utilized it to their advantage in becoming one of the most popular bands of all time. I found the AI conversations quite interesting; I was expecting it to have more feelings in a sense and speak as if it were a person. However, it basically just stated the facts and said it had no opinion on things. I am curious will AI ever have opinions of its own. If so, will that be a good thing or bad thing for the world. I am sure one day we will find out when a fully functional AI is created. I stated something earlier in this module somewhere about MySpace and how it was "remixed" into Facebook. The communication platforms we have these days is off the chain. We have Instagram, Facebook, SnapChat, X, YouTube, TikTok, Reddit, and countless others. It's almost burden some in a way to keep up with them all. However, we still utilize them because I think some of us feel if we don't utlize them we will miss out on something. One of my bosses says he has FOMO(fear of missing out) and I think that can be applicable to all of these different apps. I myself only have a few of the main apps. I refuse to use TikTok, just because I feel it serves no purpose and is just pointless. That is my opinion though and some would disagree which is totally fine. Some questions I have that have been left unanswered are do we really need AI? I just feel it may be opening a door that doesn't need to be opened. Or maybe I've just seen too many SciFi Movies.

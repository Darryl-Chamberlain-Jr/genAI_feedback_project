"Class, Personally approach I like to take to protecting myself while on public or private Wi-Fi is a big front approach. First approach is turning off auto-connect, saves you a ton of problems. Don't know how many times I have been out in public and seen random networks with some wild names with free access. Additionally, I turn off file sharing. To many stories of friends getting random pictures and sometimes some suspect files that have who knows what attached to them. Occasionally I like to use a VPN, mostly its just safe practice when suffering the internet to find information. Otherwise I keep to a handful of website I visit. Also I try to stick with HTTPS website. You really cant go wrong with browsing on an encrypted website. Lastly keeping an up to date virus subscription is probably the best step to an all around safe approach while surfing." "Smart move on the VPN and HTTPS website choice. Safe use out in public is the best practice to maintaining your personal information from theft. I'm curious to what the future of internet protection will look like, what's next after two step." "Smooth approach on the VPN use and WPA. The two step approach is something I like to use myself. Good move on the unique passwords, despite how frustrating they can be its smart to just sit down and make a good password."

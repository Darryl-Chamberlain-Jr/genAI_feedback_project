Class, The first issue is on human trafficking which is an issue not just at the southern border but all borders. This is a serious humanitarian and security concern not only for foreign citizens but also united states citizens. The best way I think to combat this issue is understanding where and how this is happening within our communities and combating the root causes of it such as drug abuse, homelessness, poverty, and crime. As well as educate our youth to understand at a young age what human trafficking is and how they can help prevent it (Davis, H. (n.d.). The second issue I wanted to talk about was drug smuggling and the trafficking of illicit drugs across the border. This is a major issue that criminal networks like the cartel to transport and distribute narcotics to the states which in turn raises crime. Some of the ways I believe we could combat this is to increase the technological level of the devices used. Such as detection technologies at border crossings and ports of entry. Third is increasing the border control budget is an issue that has always been there. I believe our borders should be the most secure locations throughout the United States. Policies should be in place just like for our military to ensure each year they have their budget evaluated and increased, there should also be polices preventing their funding from being lowered. The amount of people and drugs that cross our border illegal increases every second (BORDERLAND 2023). Lastly, using the military at our borders is an issue that has always been looked down upon, but I believe it to be an asset we do not use. There are many national guardsmen who already serve down at the border so why not increase security and authorize the military to help in prevention and capture. I think this policy would decrease illegal border crossings and prevent other forms of crime and trafficking. Resources: Davis, H. (n.d.).

The national security system's reliance on electricity introduces significant challenges to energy policy due to the vulnerabilities of the national electrical grid. These vulnerabilities include susceptibility to natural disasters, cyber and physical attacks, and the deterioration of aging infrastructure. Such weaknesses could lead to severe consequences for national security, as a reliable power supply is crucial for supporting critical functions such as defense operations and emergency services​​ (National Security and assured U.S. Electrical Power). To mitigate these risks, energy policy must focus on enhancing grid resilience and security.  Energy over-reliance can pose homeland security challenges in the U.S. and for its allies. A key concern is the disruption of the electric grid, which underpins vital military and civilian operations. If adversaries were to exploit this vulnerability strategically, it could cripple military capabilities and critical infrastructure. Additionally, reliance on an unstable and unsecured energy supply chain heightens the risk of espionage or sabotage, potentially disrupting energy supplies with extensive security implications (National Security and assured U.S. Electrical Power)​​.  Addressing these challenges requires a comprehensive approach that includes diversifying energy sources to reduce dependence on specific types of energy, such as fossil fuels. Policies must also focus on enhancing the security of energy infrastructure and integrating advanced technologies to improve grid resilience and reliability (National Security and assured U.S. Electrical Power)​​. Investing in renewable energy sources and modernizing the grid are crucial steps to mitigate the vulnerabilities associated with energy over-reliance and ensure a secure, reliable energy future capable of withstanding emerging threats and challenges​​.  These investments and policy shifts are vital for national and homeland security. Strengthening and securing the energy infrastructure not only supports military readiness but also ensures the continuity of critical civilian functions across various sectors​​. A resilient and modernized grid is less vulnerable to attacks and more capable of recovering from disruptions, thereby providing a stable and secure energy landscape essential for national security (National Security and assured U.S. Electrical Power)​​.

Here is the next student submission: The most surprising thing I learned in this module was how much rich history exists in the genre of remixed music. I think this was the most surprising thing because I listen to many of the songs played in the video and I knew that some were remixes, but I had no idea about others. The most significant communication technology in this module has to be, without a doubt, generative AI. It has so much versatility and in my experience is synthesizing novel ideas from pre-existing ones. I have written about my experience with ChatGPT helping me to code in other parts of the module, so I won’t go into detail here, but on several occasions, I have not been able to find help with a problem I’m having with online resources. Then ChatGPT quickly produces several lines of code and text that not only help me to solve my problem but also explain what each line doing. I think that the third question is particularly interesting and thought-provoking. I had not drawn the explicit parallel between something like scribes and the printing press and digital artists and something like Dalle-2. I’ve seen a lot about the fear of artists losing their jobs, and obviously, that fear must have existed when the printing press was rising in popularity. I’m curious how the fear of losing scribes waned and how the fear of losing artists will parallel that waning. As far as whether digital communication technologies are something new, I think that they definitely are. While they may initially fill the same niche in communication, they have their own flaws and strengths. Word documents can be shared over vast distances almost instantly, but if you want a physical copy, you need a whole different technology: a printer. Citations Timeline (Producer), Fry, S. (2018).

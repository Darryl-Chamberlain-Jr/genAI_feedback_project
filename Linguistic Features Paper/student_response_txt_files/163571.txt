Conflict and climate change are nearly inseparable when it comes to outlining the anthropogenic impact on how the world operates. People and businesses cause climate change due to pollution, over consumerism, and an increase of global greenhouse gas emissions (Harris, 2013). Climate change forces people to pivot into profitable economic ventures such as transnational crimes that help them stay afloat. Humans have had detrimental impact on environmental systems due to the rise of these. 15% of the world’s gross domestic product comes from organized crime (Glenny, 2009). Three crimes that are damaging the environment are the illegal trade of oil in the Islamic state, the illicit charcoal trade in East Africa, and the ivory market in Southeast Asia (Bergenas and Knight, 2015). Oil trade depletes the nonrenewable resources found within the area for a profit. The charcoal trade encourages environmental degradation due to the deforestation required to keep up with the demands for charcoal, again, for profit. Elephants and Rhinos have become endangered species due to the depletion of their homes from people cutting down trees. This, coupled with their coveted ivory tusks, have made criminals the primary threat on their survival. Humans being willing to leave the environment at the mercy of their greed to turn a profit is not a new concept. The rise of transnational crimes has created a more integral and advanced organization system that takes advantage of the inconsistence found in government policies (Canales, 2013). Transnational crimes help to stimulate the economy but have negative impact on the environment. 	Resource based conflict can have destabilizing influences on the government, economy, and human security. When there is conflict present, the state can collapse due to the weaknesses exposed by their inability to govern and protect their citizens. This can cause the state’s army and police to be dismantled and the government would be required to outsource for policing by using privatized groups like the mafia for protection (Glenny, 2009). Incorporating the mafia in state business entangles corruption into the system. Conflict can also make the economy collapse as well. When the conflict is resource based, there is a struggle to keep the production honest as the resources continue to diminish. People are led to violence to protect the resources they still have available while criminals are using force to gather the resources, they need to make their profit (Bergenas and Knight, 2015). Conflict can also wreak havoc on human right abuses such as forced labor and child labor as trafficking increases to keep up with the demand of mining and sourcing (Bergenas and Knight, 2015). The human rights abuse is able to go undetected and without interference when occurring alongside an unstable government and economy because the attention is focused greatly on those insecurities.  	The natural environment plays an important role in contributing and causing political and economic destabilization within a region. When the government continuously fails to address environmental security and all the consequential impacts that come along side it, it can cause political unrest. An example of such occurred in Syria. When they experienced a major drought that lasted three years, there was an increase in water insecurity and livestock mortality (Kelley et al, 2015). Syria’s economy largely relied on agriculture, so the environment was vital to the livelihood of the people living there. Their sitting president decided to create policies to increase agricultural production in spite of the families already suffering, causing an increase in migration and fueled their revolution (Kelley et al, 2015). Ignoring environmental changes and its effect on the people within a nation signal that the government does not care and can move people to revolt.  	Economic destabilization can lead to security concerns for the United States. The United States is a zone of consumption (Glenny, 2009). This means that the United States contributes to the buying and selling of goods and resources trades throughout the world. The western desire to consume influences global organized crime because developed countries have the money to fund these businesses while also ignoring the implications to the other nations’ environmental wellbeing. This does a disservice to the United States because it can leave them vulnerable to supporting transnational crimes that are depleting the resources in another country. One thing that the United States consumes is oil. The destabilization of the economy in a state that has oil can affect the energy costs in the United States.  The Westphalian System can be misused to support terrorism and other types of transnational crime when profit is prioritized over the global impact that enacting rules can create. The dependency that the United States has for oil can affect the quality of life for their citizens and create political unrest if their actions go against the values of the masses within their nation.

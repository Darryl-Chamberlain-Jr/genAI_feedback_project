"To protect my privacy and to safeguard my devices I try to be as proactive as possible. I use numerous different passwords that the computer would say are “strong passwords” and have two factor authentication, where I will put my password in then it will either email or text me a code to put in within 60 or 120 seconds so they know it is me. I have my devices set to update software as soon as possible so I am never behind the power curve and making sure my computer does not fall behind. My antivirus and related things are up to date constantly for that damn pesky cyber hackers and nonsense. My privacy settings are whatever the recommended thing is, I do not go overboard or anything, whatever it thinks the settings should be is what I have them as, I have never had an issue this way previously, so if it ain’t broke. I also do not go on any what I would call sketchy websites and I am not playing minesweeper with popup ads and nonsensical things clicking on them left and right randomly so I have not had any issues. As soon as my devices or apps tell me to change my password I try to make up a whole different password entirely instead of just changing one number or one special symbol." "I also thought that putting my phone in "incognito mode" putter me at a higher level of security, so I greatly appreciate you bringing this up. I am honestly not surprised that it is Google that was caught up with monitoring even in that mode. Just by talking to someone about what you want to buy or want, with your phone in your pocket, later that day there will be ads to buy that said thing, it is wild and means everything is being heard. This VPN thing is pretty legit honestly, sounds like a loophole by being able to watch shows not shown in the US and also getting cheaper prices on things, you might be on to something here and may have just got me on that VPN bandwagon. The passwords for wifi for the routers out of the box are how everyone's password should be honestly, alpha numeric and have nothing to do with us personally, and completely random." "You and I are alike when it comes to not being very savvy when it comes to these things. But upon doing this weeks homework I believe I may look into getting a VPN for the security as well as being able to watch more shows and movies when I am deployed, overseas all we have is the gym and Netflix really. I will also be more cognizant when it comes to my passwords as well as what I do on Wifi that is not my own as well as on the plane security measures. This really opened my eyes to people and cyber security attacks and things of that nature. It is crazy how people spend time out of their day to do these kinds of malicious things at airports and such, all I am trying to do is find some comfortable position on this small plane and watch some Netflix."

Class, In 1964 the United Nations (UN) passed Resolution 186, entitled "The Cyprus Question." It calls for an end to hostilities on the island. It also calls for the government of a then-unified Cyprus and the governments of Turkey and Greece to work to control violent elements amongst their respective ethnic populations. It also calls for those three governments to work with the government of the United Kingdom to bring about a peaceful resolution. The United Kingdom, which had recently released control of the island to the newly formed Cyprus government, was directed by the United Nations to act as the mediator in the conflict. It also established the first UN peacekeeping mission on the island (UN, 1964). Earlier this year, The United Nations passed resolution 2674, which extends the peacekeeping mandate of the forces in Cyprus (UN, 2023b). Resolution 186 in 1964 was a failed legal attempt, as evidenced by the fact that violence continued to build on the island, culminating in the invasion of Cyprus by Turkey in 1974. Today, most people don't think about the conflict in Cyprus very often. Still, in 1974, it was such a pressing issue that half of the Security Council resolutions involved the conflict in Cyprus (UN, 2023a). The resolution that did the most to mitigate the violence was Security Council Resolution 353. Resolution 353 expanded UN peacekeeping forces following the Turkish victory in Northern Cyprus (UN, 1974). Resolution 186 cites the UN charter as an attempt to maintain peace. As discussed in chapter 10, "Regulation of Force and Realization of Peace," from this week's reading "All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use, of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations" (UN, 1945). Legal tools failed to mitigate the crisis. What was needed was a robust and well-armed security force created in 1974 with resolution 353 (UN, 1974). Legal tools only work if both parties agree to abide by the decision reached by the appointed authority or if one side is forced to comply by the threat or an act of violence. Throughout the last 50 years, many of the peace talks and attempts at reunification have focused primarily on Turkish and Greek security concerns and have not focused on the Right to Return of refugee populations from both ethnic groups (Loizides & Anotoniades, 2009). In 1998, the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) ruled in favor of a Greek Cypriot woman, Tiriana Loizidou, who was driven out of Northern Cyprus during the conflict. She first filed the case with the ECHR in 1974. In 2003, the Turkish government paid her the settlement reached by the court. A Turkish foreign minister claimed that even though the ruling was incorrect, they would comply with the court's order (BBC, 2003).   BBC.

[name] An example of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) being able to work with India and Pakistan in conflict resolution is the case of an Indian national named Jadhav. Mr. Jadhav was arrested in Pakistan and sentenced to death for espionage, terrorism, and sabotage (Kattan, 2020). In 2017, India filed a complaint against Pakistan in the ICJ, claiming that Pakistan did not inform Mr. Jadhav of his rights and that Pakistan had denied India the ability to meet with and advise their nationals. These rights are detailed under the Vienna Convention. The court found that the Islamic Republic of Pakistan did violate international law. Following the decision, Pakistan allowed India to meet with Mr. Jadhav. Mr. Jadhav is still on death row in Pakistan, but his rights as an Indian national are now being respected (Kattan, 2020).    In cases like the one of Mr. Jadhav that are of little importance on the international stage, I believe legal tools in institutions such as the ICJ serve an essential function. However, it should be noted that if Pakistan had refused to allow India to provide legal counsel to Mr. Jadhav, there would be nothing the ICJ could do about it. If an international body or court provided A sweeping proclamation to the Kashmir question, I do not believe either side would respect the court's findings. Would love to hear what you think. I've also provided links to the ICJ's notes on the case of Mr. Jadhav if anyone's interested. https://www.icj-cij.org/case/168Links to an external site.  https://www.icj-cij.org/node/105828Links to an external site.   [name], Third-party mediations and conciliations like the ones you've discussed have been used successfully in other conflicts with Israel in the past. The Camp David Accords in 1978 used The United States under President Jimmy Carter as the mediator and successfully negotiated peace between Egypt and Israel. More recently, the Abraham Accords normalizing relations between Israel, Bahrain, and The United Arab Emirates, followed later by Morocco and Sudan, was mediated by the United States under President Donald Trump. In the Camp David Accords and the Abraham Accords, both sides of the negotiation were nation-states that had an interest in finding a way to make peace. Both sides wanted to secure their territory or had an economic interest in normalizing trade. The issue with dealing with a terrorist organization like Hamas is that their stated goal is the eradication of the Jewish State. Hamas has also continuously violated international law and just yesterday broke the ceasefire agreement. Do you believe that any negotiated peace with the genocidal terrorist organization can be trusted?

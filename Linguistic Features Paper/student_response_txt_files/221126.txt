"Privacy is of the utmost importance when using the internet in the 21st century. Every ad that pops up on Google seems specifically tailored to what the user wants or has wanted in the past. Not only does looking something up online get these targeted ads, but also speaking about something you want to purchase near a smartphone's microphone can also occur these ads as well. Anonymity is a thing of the past when purchasing airplane tickets for a specific date or time seems to be out the window, and when looking at the same plane ticket twice, it incurs random penalties or increases prices just for looking it up. My personal approach when needing privacy when online is using a Virtual Private Network (VPN). This is a paid service that helps users skirt away from what Internet Service Providers (ISP) and search engines like Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo, and even Yahoo know about your computer and what you are looking up online. I keep all my router and modem settings updated with the newest firmware along with my home desktop and laptop computers with antivirus as well." "Good Evening [name], I agree with you that anything you post on the Internet will be considered public information. It is hard to keep data secure in this day and age. Does using multiple email addresses keep down spam? I've heard in the past that regardless of what email address you use, there are enough cookies from websites that spam will eventually flood any email mailbox. I like how you have new passwords for different websites. By using this methodology it keeps your data safe from hackers." "Good Evening [name], I agree that having a secure password and two-factor authentication is a wonderful way of safeguarding one's information. One can never be too careful with either publicized information or hackers knowing every password you have by reusing one password over and over again. By ensuring that you have the most up to date software like anti-virus, and also updating your router it can help prevent hackers getting into your computer and knowing everything about you. Ensuring your guests only have a guest password on home wifi is also a way to prevent unauthorized people from using or staying on your wifi."

Transnational Crime and Environmental Insecurity Westphalian sovereignty, more commonly referred to as the Westphalian System, is the international principle that sovereign states have exclusive control over land within their respective territory. Still, despite numerous nuanced social, political, and economic advantages of national independence, the existence of sovereign state borders has been complicit in the evolution of cross-border terrorism and transnational crime. Understanding the correlation between increasing transnational crime and terrorism further exacerbated by environmental insecurity and climate change is essential for problem-framing national defense strategies in the 21st century. Firstly, one must recognize how regions and populations can become destabilized because of resource scarcity.  Resource Scarcity Fuels Resource-based Conflict Resource-based conflict is a broad term that describes disagreements over access, use, or control of natural resources. These conflicts may be either social or political and the parties involved may be either two conflicting individuals or groups part of either state or non-state entities. An example of how a terror organization’s illicit funding damages the natural environment while also creating incredible amounts of suffering across the world can be found in how the Islamic State illegally trades oil across the Middle East, eventually turning this act into their top source of income (Bergenas & Knight, 2015). These illegal oil trades, which at one point were estimated to have generated more than $3 million a day (Al-Khatteeb & Gordts, 2014), are used for financing a wide array of terrorist activities ranging from recruitment, propaganda campaigns, weapon and equipment purchases, and logistics. Additionally, these illegal oil operations also inflict damage to the environment by contributing to unhealthy levels of water decontamination and widespread land degradation. Understanding how terrorism and conflict negatively influence economics is also critical in analyzing past, present, and future international security threats.  Environmental Insecurity and Economic Destabilization Terroristic and criminal acts are being committed across the world, and many of these human actions have severe consequences on both large populations and the economies of sovereign states. The increase of a highly connected world has opened the possibilities for new trade routes which also channel material or items that may be legal or cheap in one country and illegally import or smuggle them into another. An example of this can be found in the international timber market. According to the International Criminal Police Organization (INTERPOL), nearly 30% of all timber trade across the world is considered illegal (Bergenas & Knight, 2015). The impact of illegal timber trade on an economy can be devastating. Illicit timber trade reduces the amount of government funds that could be better spent on other sustainability practices and in some cases such as what has occurred in Indonesia, the amount of money lost to illegal forestry and government corruption toward the environment costs more than the state’s annual budget for health care (Bergenas & Knight, 2015).  Political and economic instability heavily influenced by events that impact the natural environment can also pose a concern for U.S. national security. Migrants fleeing oppressive regimes, poverty, and famine have also been extorted by cartels across Mexico, Central America, and South America. As a cost for being illegally trafficked into the United States, some transnational criminal organizations (TCOs) use migrants as drug smugglers or ‘mules’ for moving drugs or other illegal products or material from Central and South American suppliers to the world’s largest consumer of illegal substances – The United States. These TCOs inflict devastating trauma to societies through multiple channels. Each year, tens of thousands of U.S. citizens die or are permanently disabled from drug overdoses in addition to those who die because of drug-related violence. The current drug epidemic in the United States has proven to be a boon for narcoterrorism since it is smaller in size and more potent when compared to heroin, methamphetamine, or marijuana (Canles, 2013).

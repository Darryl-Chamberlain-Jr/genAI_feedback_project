Ok so here is what I got: 400\left(1.08\right)^t=10,000 \frac{400\left(1.08\right)^t}{400}=\frac{10,000}{400} 1.08^t=25 In1.08^t=In25 \frac{In1.08^t}{In1.08}=\frac{In25}{In1.08} t=\frac{In25}{In1.08} t=42 years (rounded to the nearest whole number) 2. It looks like to me that the student didn't get the like terms to one side of the equation, and they also multiplied the 400 and 1.08 before it was time for it. Also, the inserted the Natural Logarithm before it was time to. 3. I do not believe that the student provided the correct work in this problem. Let me know if I missed anything. Thanks, [name]

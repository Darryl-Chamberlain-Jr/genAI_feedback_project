Here is the next student submission: One of the most surprising things I learned in this module was the rich and diverse history of todays remix culture. The progression of remixing from music and audio to the evolution of print and visual application was very interesting and shed some light on how the newer generations create and share content across multiple platforms. Overall, I think the most significant communication technology contribution to human history in this module was the creation and induction of the internet. The ability to transmit information and communication across vast distances instantaneously has shaped out society to what it is today. It has now touched every aspect of communications technology by allowing instant transmission of audio (music streaming, podcasts, phones), Visual (Social media, websites, gaming), and print (documents, pictures, news). It has now even progressed to societal infrastructure such as utilities and vehicles used in every facet of life. In my opinion, digital technologies represent both new and reimagined versions of analog ancestors. Digital communication technologies have converged into unified formats and have transformed how we process information and content. In addition, The creation of the entirely new augmented reality and virtual reality have given us means of communication that our ancestors could only have dreamed of. With all of the induction of new digital communications technologies and the various materials and additional power needed for them, I have wondered what kind of environmental impacts will stem from continuing these technologies. As we move to a more digital world, we seem to be less and less concerned for the physical world we inhabit. I plan to continue self research and monitor information from various environmental agencies for potential impacts relating to digital communications technologies in the future.

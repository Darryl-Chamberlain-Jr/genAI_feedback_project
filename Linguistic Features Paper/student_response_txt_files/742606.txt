"Personally, one of the most critical measures in safeguarding my devices would be a secure password with two factor authentication. A unique password at that. Ensuring I have a reliable anti-virus protection as well. Thankfully, nowadays most routers Wi-Fi settings can be accessed through mobile application. Thus, controlling who can register their device on the Wi-Fi, restricting certain devices from accessing your internet. Creating a strong password for your Wi-fi as well, not just your devices could help with security measures. Firewalls can also assist in security. Another great way to keep security in check would allowing guest accounts on your devices, and the Wi-Fi. Guests accounts can limit the access if ever someone were to use your personal devices and Wi-Fi. I myself have guests accounts on all of my devices due to security purposes. This allows me to have a peace of mind if someone else needs to access any of my devices. I also practice unique password and two factor authentication on all devices of mine. " I like your approach. Apple is more secure than windows computers, so you don't really have to consider anti-virus protection as much. Which is great, sometimes all it takes is not clicking on unknown websites or pop up ads. " "I really enjoyed reading your take on the example discussion. VPN's are a better way to secure yourself when on Wi-Fi, and not a lot of people utilize them. It is great to see you discuss the use and benefit of them. Awesome post."

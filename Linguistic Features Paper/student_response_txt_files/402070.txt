Environmental crime presents a challenge that extends beyond its direct environmental impacts. Criminal activities such as illegal logging, wildlife trafficking, and pollution may not be the largest illicit economies compared to industries like pharmaceuticals, electronics, and cigarettes, but they are deeply intertwined with sophisticated transnational organized crime groups. These criminal networks are often involved in various illicit activities, including the trade in drugs, arms, humans, and counterfeit goods (Glenny, 2009). This integration highlights the complexity of addressing environmental crime and the need for coordinated efforts across multiple sectors. Moreover, environmental crime tends to thrive in regions characterized by high levels of corruption and limited institutional capacity. In many developing countries, natural resource exploitation is intricately linked to economic strength, further complicating efforts to combat environmental degradation (Harris, 2013). The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) estimates that the direct economic impact of environmental crime amounts to $135 billion, a figure equivalent to the combined global value of official development aid (Bergenas & Knight, 2015). This underscores the significant economic ramifications of environmental degradation and the urgency of addressing this issue in the context of sustainable development goals. Securing the world's natural resources from terrorists and transnational criminal syndicates is increasingly recognized as essential for achieving sustainable development goals (Harris, 2013). The forthcoming United Nations Sustainable Development Goals emphasize the importance of environmental protection and restoration on a global scale. However, the growing role of the natural environment in contributing to political and economic destabilization is evident in regions where environmental degradation exacerbates socio-economic inequalities, undermines governance structures, and fuels social unrest (Harris, 2013). Environmental crime represents a twenty-first-century challenge that transcends traditional boundaries, affecting defense, security, development, and conservation efforts worldwide (Harris, 2013). Its global reach and transnational nature require innovative prevention and mitigation strategies that involve collaboration between governments, non-governmental organizations, and the private sector. Political and economic destabilization resulting from environmental degradation and resource-based conflicts can have significant security implications for the U.S. Instability in strategically important regions can disrupt trade, energy supplies, and geopolitical alliances, posing threats to U.S. interests and necessitating diplomatic, humanitarian, and security interventions to mitigate risks and maintain stability (Bergenas & Knight, 2015). Additionally, environmental crime, with its global reach and transnational nature, can contribute to the proliferation of terrorism, extremism, and organized crime, further complicating security challenges for the U.S. (Harris, 2013). Effective solutions must address the intertwined issues of environmental degradation, criminal activity, and sustainable development while balancing both public and private interests.

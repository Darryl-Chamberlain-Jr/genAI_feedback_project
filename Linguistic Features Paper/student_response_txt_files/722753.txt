"Protecting privacy online is very important and has grown increasingly more difficult. Keeping your information and devices safe should always be a priority. My first step is to stay away from sites that are not legitimate, especially if payment is involved. There are a lot of copycat sites that pose as actual sites, so being weary has helped me stay safe. Another approach to protecting privacy is being cautious of the networks that you connect your device to. Wi-Fi networks will pop up for you to connect to when in public, like the airport. Ensuring that you connect to the actual secure network is very important. Connecting to someone's hotspot or a faux network can give someone access to your device and access to information. I also use antivirus software and ensure that the software is up to date. At home, my router is password protected, and guest access is restricted to prevent outsiders from accessing my network and devices. On the topic of passwords, I use unique passwords on all devices and accounts and use two-factor authentication when possible." Public networks can be risky, and we should be cautious when connecting. I also use a VPN to ensure my privacy. Macafee is also my go-to antivirus. So far, I have had no security issues using it and some of the similar tactics you discussed. "I agree that there is a way to overprotect privacy online, meaning paying for too much security that may not be needed, so I do the minimum of having an antivirus on my computer. Like health insurance, it's nice to have when you need it, but it feels useless when it's not in use."

An electricity-reliant national security system creates a variety of challenges for energy policy. Being electricity-reliant creates weakness with the electricity supply, it could be from natural disasters, terrorist attacks, or lots of other reasons. Relying heavily on electricity leaves little room for error in energy planning. Troubles in electricity supply, like outages or blackouts, can have a lot of consequences. This could impact critical infrastructure and even affect national security. Interferences in one part of the grid could spread to other areas and this could cause outages. To solve these issues, there needs to be energy policies that focus on building resilience and diversifying energy sources and improving the energy sector (Energy Security Matters n.d.).  Energy over-reliance can cause homeland security challenges in the United States and for its allies. Having a dependence on only one energy source can create weaknesses for critical infrastructure. This weakness doesn't just impact power grids it also affects healthcare, transportation, and communication methods, which all need electricity to run. This can impact public safety and emergency response during disasters. 
Depending too much on energy imports from politically unstable regions could put nations at risk of geopolitical problems (Energy Efficiency n.d.). Conflicts in these areas could impact energy supplies and could cause economic instability or security concerns.  Energy over-reliance can pressure diplomatic interactions and weaken agreements between countries. When a country relies on energy imports from just one source, it might feel like it needs to prioritize energy over foreign policy goals. This could weaken its ability to engage in global affairs. Differences in energy security among allies can create weakness within alliances, because of their ability to handle energy disruptions, nations have different interests and priorities.  To help fix these issues, politicians must use a universal method to energy security that incorporates broadening energy sources, investing in strong infrastructure, and promoting energy efficiency. It is important to reduce dependence on only one energy source and improve resilience in critical infrastructure, countries can mitigate the risks linked to energy over-reliance and strengthen homeland security. By working together and coordinating with allies on energy planning and response this can increase security and resilience among changing energy challenges. References Electricity security matters.

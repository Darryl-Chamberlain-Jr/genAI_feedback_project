"Good morning class, I have always been cautious whenever I am purchasing anything online. Whenever I purchase anything online I would only use ApplePay, PayPal, or Klarna since I know my bank account information is encrypted and my information is not shared with the seller. Another extra step I like to keep in mind is to only purchasing items online when I am at home using my own Wi-Fi since I know using public Wi-Fi allows anyone with the right equipment to access my information. I aso appreciate apple because it gives me the option to let an app to use my microphone or camera whenever I am using it and turning off GPS on apps that I know don’t need my location. A security measure that took for protecting my router is using a strong password with capitals, numbers, and special characters. I also like to see which devices are connected and disconnect any devices that i do not recognize." "I think it really smart move of you to disconnect old devices or not in use devices. Since i have spectrum i like to mange the devices through the website. I definitely agree with you that you should be aware with what devices you allow your phone to trust. " "That’s a real smart move of using a VPN when using public Wi-Fi. I do also believe that every one should be aware of the dangers of cyber threats so they can keep their information protected. Would you happen to have the name of the antivirus software you use in order to protect your devices? "

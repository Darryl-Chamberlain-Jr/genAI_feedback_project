National security systems reliant on electricity pose a myriad of challenges to the energy policy. One of those challenges is that reliance on electricity does not stop the overall rise in emissions at national level. Another challenge is that over-reliance on electricity for national security systems makes those systems more vulnerable and their degradation would greatly hinder other facets of national security. 	Electricity reliance of national security systems does not do much to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the focal point of modern energy policy reforms. According to Toke and Vezirgiannidou (2013), electricity reliance has not stopped the overall rise in emissions at a national level. Diversifying our energy resources, even for our national security systems, is vital if we are to continue to strive for the reduction of greenhouse gases. 	National security systems reliant on electricity are vulnerable to operational interruption, hindering national security capabilities. This makes our means of electricity distribution a prime target for an attack (CNA, 2015). A reason that this is important is because all our homeland’s critical infrastructure is all interconnected (CISA, n.d.). With all 16 of the critical infrastructure sectors being interconnected, one national security system being affected could hinder other areas of critical infrastructure. The loss of one sector would be extremely debilitating as they all have interdependencies. For example, if an attack took out part of our electrical power grid it would greatly hinder our emergency response and recovery capabilities in the affected area. There would be no power, which means there would be nothing to power the telecommunication towers, greatly degrading communications between emergency service and assets in the affected area. And with no power, it could affect water control stations obstructing access to clean water sources. This can hinder our own capacity to conduct homeland security operations, as well as response for aid of our allies. 	The reliance on electricity doesn’t do much to reach our goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and it also makes our national security systems vulnerable to attack and degradation. It is imperative find more diverse means to fuel our national security systems. REFERENCES CISA. (n.d.). Energy Sector.

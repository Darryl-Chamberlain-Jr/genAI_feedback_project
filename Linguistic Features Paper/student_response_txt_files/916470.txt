In the modern world, we all rely on electricity to keep our cell phones charged, movie nights, and cold air from air conditioning. In the United States, the power grid is made up of three sections: Eastern, Western, and ERCOT interconnections. There are also twelve transmission planning regions. Eleven are governed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), and the twelfth is governed by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT). Out of twelve regions, only six are Independent System Operators. Currently, the U.S. is the only country with a microgrid. China and the European Union both have continental- or national-scale grid development plans (Einberger, 2023). It is very problematic for the U.S. because of extreme weather changes associated with climate change, cyberattacks, and direct physical attacks. Extreme weather changes are much more significant than grid planning regions and fragmented grids. 	Although climate change has become a more prominent topic of discussion worldwide, the relationship between climate change and energy security has yet to undergo much work. It is a vital issue to discuss because energy is responsible for approximately sixty percent of emissions worldwide. Tracking emissions is a crucial step in mitigating climate change. Access to energy is also viewed as a strategic concern for foreign policy. Reliance on one supplier or importing energy from other regions can cause geo-political gain (Toke and Vezirgiannidou, 2013). 	Over-reliance on energy can create risks for Homeland Security and the allies by creating economic instability. Current U.S. President Joe Biden has banned all oil, natural gas, and coal imports from Russia. This has created economic challenges for the U.S. and its allies due to the increase in gas prices and disruption of supply chains (Rowland-Shea et al., 2022). Energy over-reliance can also cause increased cyber threats to undermine or temper with the system, causing malfunctions and electricity outages in the cities. If a cyberattack cuts power supply to the city in the winter, it could cause the loss of many people. References: Einberger, M. (2023, January 12).

The relationship between crime and climate change is complex. Many less-developed nations experience destabilization from climate change-induced weather changes (Harris, 2013). Deforestation for agriculture contributes to soil erosion, disruption of water cycles, loss of fertile land, and increased susceptibility to natural disasters such as floods (Harris, 2013). Although humans are the primary cause of climate change, they are also victims of its adverse effects (Harris, 2013). Severe droughts and intense flooding lead to impaired food and water supply (Harris, 2013). Conflict often arises due to limited resources, which escalates tensions and sparks disputes (Kelley et al., 2015). The Syrian civil war presents a notable example of how water insecurity triggers conflict (Kelley et al., 2015). Intense drought, poor resource management, and agricultural exploitation played a role in the uprising (Kelley et al., 2015). While a lack of natural resources can cause conflict, Bergenas and Knight (2015) recognize that resources can also be exploited for financial gain, including by known terrorist groups such as the al-Qaeda-linked al-Shabaab. The illegal trading of timber, oil, and other natural assets underscores the necessity for a comprehensive approach to addressing environmental crime (Bergenas & Knight, 2015). Environmental crime affects worldwide security, sustainable development, and conservation endeavors (Bergenas & Knight, 2015). TED (2009) points out the connection between global crime networks, the global economy, and violence in already unstable places. Crime significantly impacts food, governments, communications, and livelihoods (TED, 2009). TED (2009) notes that by 2000, approximately 80% of the world's coltan originated from the conflict-ridden areas of the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The DRC has some of the most conflicts on the planet as Mafia groups globally collaborate with regional paramilitary forces to control the abundant mineral 2 resources in the area (TED, 2009. These crime groups exacerbated tensions and contributed to ongoing issues in the area (TED, 2009). The involvement of organized crime networks aggravates these issues and undermines efforts to promote environmental sustainability and security. This scenario implies significant implications for environmental security as exploiting natural resources in conflict zones, such as the DRC, can contribute to environmental degradation instability and threaten biodiversity. The destruction of critical ecosystems causes pollution and releases greenhouse gases (Harris, 2013). Unfortunately, the primary catalyst for international organized crime is the Western demand for consumption (TED, 2009). Environmental organizations have traditionally undertaken this problem, encountering obstacles like bureaucratic challenges and rivalry among non-governmental entities (Bergenas & Knight, 2015). Corruption, resource constraints, and ineffective judicial systems cause governments to encounter difficulties upholding environmental regulations (Bergenas & Knight, 2015). TED (2013) recognizes that there is a substantial demand for illegal drugs and a connection between drug trafficking and violence. While there have been efforts to combat drug violence, drug cartels are using sophisticated brand management, and policymakers play a role in perpetuating the cycle of violence and criminal activity through their legislative decisions, regulatory frameworks, and enforcement practices (TED, 2013). Consumers are also complicit in this cycle as those who purchase goods from industries known for environmental degradation, human rights abuses, or exploitation are a part of continuing these harmful activities (TED, 2013). In conclusion, human-induced climate change and natural resource exploitation have multifaceted repercussions threatening human and environmental security. 3 References Bergenas, J., & Knight, A.

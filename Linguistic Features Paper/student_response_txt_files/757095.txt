Resource based conflict can be very damaging to the people that are caught in between the conflict as the destabilizing influences during and after the conflict can remain within the environment for a long period of time. When it comes to fighting over resources, what exactly are those resources? Resources could be food, water, raw material, oil, and more natural resources. The conflict could be political or it could break down to an all-out war if people are pushed far enough. Disagreements over how water or land is used for example, can lead to a population either without water or without food due to the scarcity of water or due to the infertile soil in the ground. Many of these issues can stem from climate change as the source of the issue, and can lead to more disastrous situations such as war. According to the Global Humanitarian Forum, “climate change harms people in many ways, particularly in the following areas: Food Security, Health, Poverty, Water, Displacement, and Security.” (Harris, 2013). All of these issues can be destabilizing influences when it comes to a resource based conflict.  The environment plays a role in the situation of causing political and economic destabilization. The reason as to why, is due to the fact that the pollution caused through industrialization has increased the levels of CO2 in the atmosphere which has increased temperatures globally. The increase in temperatures has caused irregular weather patterns and droughts in some agriculturally sound parts of the world. This is creating a problem as it is getting more difficult to farm crops and create produce for the populations. An increase in temperature has also melted glaciers which are increasing the sea levels of the world. This is another issue as coastal cities or towns are now prone to flooding and eroding of their coast lines. This has been a CenterPoint in politics and economics as climate change is costing a lot of money, but also is being debated across the politicians on what exactly needs to be done or not done about it.  Political or Economic destabilization can lead to security concerns for the US as an increase in costs for the environment can dampen the economics of the US and can serve as a topic of debate in the political field. Having a divided lines of thought from the population in the US can lead to disagreements over climate change resolutions. Having a suffering economy can lead to an increase in prices or worse an overall failure or crash of the economy. Such an event would make the US vulnerable to foreign interference or intervention.

"As I've stated before, I'm not very good with technology. When it comes to the internet and security I don't know very much about it. I typically try to stay on reliable sites such as .gov, .org, and .edu. I also use a VPN on all devices that I possibly can. When going through a website I leave if it directs me to any ads and/or sketchy pages. I also try to avoid pages with a lot of ads. For passwords I change them every few months and try to make them as strong as possible. I also try to make my passwords with a capital, a lower case, a number, a special character, and at least 10 characters long. This does become difficult to keep track of, so I keep them listed in a notebook which I do realize isn't very secure. It's either I write them down or I forget them, so I chose the latter." "I forgot to add what my home router settings are. Since I don't know anything about those settings, I've just left them at the default." "Thank you for sharing your post. I really like how you research the latest threats, that will make you more than capable of dealing with them if and when they arise. I also like that you use a VPN on public Wi-Fi." "I appreciate your post. I wish I was as vigilant as you are when it comes to my online security. I just can't seem to get into the whole technology thing. It seems like you have most of your bases covered.

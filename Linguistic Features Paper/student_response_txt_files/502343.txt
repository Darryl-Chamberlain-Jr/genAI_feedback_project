"Protecting privacy online is crucial given the connectivity we experience in contemporary society. Some measures that I integrate to safeguard my privacy and my devices include two-factor authentication, strong passwords, firewall protection, and regular software updates. Two-factor authentication is essential for the provision of an extra layer of security. I use strong passwords on my online accounts, such as my Email account to secure my information. I find firewall protection to be effective, especially in monitoring and controlling incoming and outgoing network traffic. Moreover, updating my devices to the latest software is essential to securing my devices since the updates come with security features. The router security settings you choose to apply at home include enabling WPA2 or WPA3 encryption, guest network, and SSID broadcasting. Enabling WPA2 or WPA3 encryption is essential to prevent unauthorized access to my WI-FI network. Setting up a guest network in a separate SSID is essential to prevent guests from using my main network. Lastly, I integrate SSID broadcasting to reduce the visibility of my network to online attackers." "I agree with you, there are various precautions to protect your devices and safeguard your online presence. It is essential to avoid online networks since some are used as bait by online attackers who end up accessing your confidential information. MacAfee anti-virus is essential in detecting online hackers. I also use a VPN to protect my privacy from online scams." "I agree with you that public networks can be risky, and we should avoid connecting with them. I also integrate a VPN to protect my privacy from online attackers. I also use MacAfee as my go-to antivirus. So far, it has been effective in scanning for malware. Moreover, I update it regularly on my computer. Based on the router features, integrating guest networks is essential to prevent them from accessing your main network."

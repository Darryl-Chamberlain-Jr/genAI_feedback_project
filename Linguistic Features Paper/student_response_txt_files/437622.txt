"In an age fueld by technology, privacy is becoming less and less acessible. There are a few things you an do give yourself additonal privacy. I only use apps lile whats app or telegram for textings because they're end to end encrypted. I always use a VPN so my IP adress is secure. I also, don't allow apps like facebook or snapchat to have acess to my location. (I personally think the apps track you irregardless, especially snapchat because I'll use the prompt "McDonalds Near Me" and it will pull the nearest one. When I ask how it knew I was in Ginowan, Okinawa it'll say "I don't have acess to your location" so I ask "how did you know where I was? It responds with "I don't know where you are because I don't have acess to your location." So I ask it how did it know where the McDonalds was, and it says "I must have misspoke, I dont know where you are.") On my macbook, same thing. I use a VPN. Since I live in the barracks, I don't have control over the WiFI router settings." "By combining these security measures with your VPN usage and being mindful of your online activities, you are taking proactive steps towards safeguarding your privacy and data in today's digital landscape. Keep up the good work in prioritizing your cybersecurity!" "Adopting practices like refraining from clicking on suspicious links or pop-ups, as well as attempting to diversify your passwords, are positive steps towards enhancing your personal cybersecurity. As the aviation industry transitions towards a more personalized tech-centric experience, with an emphasis on using personal devices on public networks, it's wise to prioritize security considerations. Sharing public networks in crowded spaces like airports can indeed pose certain risks, making it crucial to bolster your defenses. Stay knowledgable about the security measures implemented by service providers to ensure a safe and seamless user experience. Also, explore additional security measures such as two-factor authentication, regular software updates, and education on recognizing phishing attempts to fortify your digital safety."

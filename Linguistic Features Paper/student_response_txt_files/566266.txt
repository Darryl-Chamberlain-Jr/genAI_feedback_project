British journalist Misha Glenny (2009, 07:50) argued in 2009, that the biggest genocide since the end of World War II, destroying the lives of more than 5 million people, was happening in the Democratic Republic of Kongo (DRK). According to him and other scientists like Canales (2013), the main root cause for those atrocities is connected to a powerful, highly integrated and worldwide operating “sinister” (Glenny, 2009, 04:50) criminal business network. It operates on the grounds of any other successful commercial activity. Insofar as such business networks entail production zones, mainly in underdeveloped countries like Afghanistan (Glenny, 2009) which are rich of scarce natural resources, followed by countries like Mexico (Canales, 2013) which act as distributor hubs. Finally such criminal business networks find the required consumer base in developed European countries or the United States (US). In view of the existing state-centric “Westphalian” (Harris, 2013, p. 143) oriented approach to international conflict resolution, this new 21st century dilemma appears to call for more innovative and community-oriented approaches towards the environmental security and conflict nexus. For countries like the DRK, Peru and Afghanistan (Glenny, 2009; Bergenas & Knight, 2015), economic prosperity is primarily linked to the effective and efficient exploitation of their existing natural and valuable mineral resources like gold, coltan, or ruby. Worldwide increasing demand for those minerals does not only lead to astronomic high prices for consumers on one hand and insane revenue potential for producers on the other hand. Bergenas and Knight (2015) underline that this focus on revenue generation based on scarce resources promotes not only intra country conflict and violence like in the DRK (Glenny, 2009), illegal mining or deforestation. Also, focus on revenue generation via exploitation of scarce resources supports and finances international terrorism of groups like the “Islamic State terrorist network” (Bergenas & Knight, 2015, p. 123). Thus, environmental destruction contributes to geopolitical destabilization and fueling of further inter state conflicts. Additionally, like in the case of Mexico, Peru, or Indonesia (Bergenas & Knight, 2015), conflicts regarding valuable natural resources carry the potential to undermine the foundations and proper functioning of a political system and existing rule of law (Canales, 2013). Ultimately, primarily local societies are confronted with increased levels of corruption, fraud, money laundering, civil unrest like in Syria (Kelley et al., 2015), and infringement of human rights in view of existing or developing conflicts related to scarce resources. All elements together lead to a deterioration of the set of dimensions of human security stipulated by the United Nations (UN) (UNDP, 1994).  Both, the World Bank Group (2022) and Keating (2015) argue that conflicts represented by civil unrest and subsequent revolution against the established state in Syria (Kelley et al., 2015), are not directly and originally induced by the natural environment. On one hand, human induced climate change worsens already dire drought conditions like in Syria (Kelley et al., 2015). Consequently, worsening environmental conditions put established social structures and traditional ways to resolve conflict to the test. Thus, it is rather about fueling than generating a civil war situation. On the other hand, scarcity of natural resources like in the DRK (Glenny, 2009), i.e., the natural environment, appears to fuel violent conflict, human rights infringement, and other atrocities, as the country’s degree of prosperity is very much dependent on those natural resources (Keating, 2015). Hence, the environmental security and conflict nexus appears to be characterized by a degree of individual influence exercised by human induced climate change combined with the level of a state’s or community’s dependency on natural resources. For consumer countries (Glenny, 2009) of scarce natural resources like the US, the consequences are felt on different security dimensions. First, the US financial and economic security has already been tested by criminals like “Bernie Madoff” (Glenny, 2009, 11:28) using extensive money laundering practices which led to significant tax shortfalls for the US. Second, community and individual security of US citizens is threatened due to the increase of violence related to narcotics “consumption and production” (Glenny, 2009, 15:11). Third, the organized criminal networks behind the global illicit trade with natural resources represent a threat to US national security, as different terrorist groups are financed with the generated revenues. Finally, economic and political destabilization in countries which are subject to the exploitation of natural resources can provoke major immigration waves towards countries like the US representing a challenge for its own society and national security.

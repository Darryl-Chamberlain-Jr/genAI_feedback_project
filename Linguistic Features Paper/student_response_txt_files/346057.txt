Resource-based conflict plays a significant role in destabilizing local and national economies. Take into account the influence that poaching, deforestation, and illegal diamond and coltan mining have had on the continent of Africa (Bergenas & Knight, 2015). Such illegal activities create power vacuums that give rise to terrorist organizations and cartels eager to profit off of the trade. As they are used to operating outside of the law, they have little moral imperative to act justly in the interest of civilian or environmental welfare. In some cases, certain government agents may even become involved, facilitating dirty dealings that hurt their local environment in the name of economic gain or greater international influence.  In addition to the potential for creating armed or militant conflict, threatened resources can have other lasting impacts. These include loss of biodiversity through poaching and illegal fishing, environmental degradation through deforestation and illegal timber trade, and social unrest for the communities most impacted by resource losses. Social unrest is a particularly alarming threat, as it can lead to the overthrowing of a government, the decimation of a people group, or even international conflict. One cited reason for the continuation of climate destruction is overconsumption (Harris, 2013). The United States is particularly guilty of this, with a prime example being our insatiable need for cobalt, even at the risk of Congolese lives (Smith, 2023). America’s endless gluttony and greed leave it vulnerable in the wake of social unrest. Should the Congolese fight back and refuse to provide cobalt to the US, electronic manufacturing would come to a halt, jeopardizing jobs and much of the US economy. As a result, America would experience its own social unrest, destabilizing the political environment and threatening current foreign policy. Such an event could cause a domino effect, with other nations refusing to provide resources to the US due to the effect resource acquisition has on their own environments. While the United States is not the center of the world, it has an undeniable effect on global trade and international commerce. Its economic failure could bring about international depression, a haunting reality in the wake of environmental insecurity. References Bergenas, J., & Knight, A. (2015).

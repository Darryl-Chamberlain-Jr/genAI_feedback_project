Here is the next student submission: The one thing that I enjoyed the most was reading up on generative AI. AI is also one of the most significant evolutions in human history. As we continue to evolve, artificial intelligence will become a part of our lives. We see it happening every day when we ask SIRI or Alexa for the weather, address lookup, recipe lookup, and many other things we communicate with an AI. AI is also present when we do school; some of the most significant AI tools that I have heard of are ChatGPT and Grammarly. I constantly use Grammarly to help me write my papers; I struggle with spelling, punctuation, and writing mechanics. Grammarly helps out my writing skills to a point where I can see improvement in my writing. Sometimes, I get incredibly frustrated with the AI tool because it shows how much I need to learn and improve my writing. I also found that a new tool in Grammarly will take your paper, and you select your topic, generating a brand new paper with much better word choices. I tend to avoid this feature because I still want my papers to be in my own words and only allow Grammarly to fix the mechanics of my papers. There are also generative AIs that help you with your research, like Bings GPT-4, but just like our reading, how can we avoid plagiarism? I wonder how different schools like middle school, high school, college, and university will handle these new AI online tools. Because right now we have zero tolerance for plagiarism, if we use an AI system where it summarizes the author's content just like we do, should we be allowed to use the AI tool? As we continue to evolve and more AI tools become available, it will be interesting to watch how we adapt to these new tools.

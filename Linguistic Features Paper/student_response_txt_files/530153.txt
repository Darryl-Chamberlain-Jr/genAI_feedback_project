"Sup y'all, Module 7 lets go! We're almost there class, For this discussion I am going to start off with my own personal experiences from traveling, rather than a google answer. I hope this is sufficient. So basically traveling is my hobby. Im a seasonal wildland firefighter and when I get my lay off, I make a point to go on a 2-4 week trip to multiple foreign countries. Traveling is 100% my biggest hobby, and it is always adventure related. I grew up before all of this modern technology, so I was raised to be accustomed to: #1 listen to music or #2 read a book. Old habits die hard, and I greatly enjoy both of these things, so typically when I travel these are my main go-to's. That being said, as both myself and technology have grown, Netflix and mobile streaming apps became a thing so I grew to pre-download cinematic experiences rather than using the airlines software. Nothing against them, just throughout my life I have become very self sufficient so I try not to rely on tings like that; even today there are airlines without a touch screen TV screen. That being said, my most absolute favorite thing abut airline technology is the GPS tracker of where the airplane is currently. Regardless of if it is a long fight or a short fight, I constantly follow that thing and personally it makes my trip so much more enjoyable. Especially for the long hauls like SE Asia or Dubai." Solid post man and you bring up some very valid points. I have been considering switching to a VPN recently and after reading your post, it has helped solidify that it is probably a good choice. The marketing tactics and privacy violations are getting out of hand. This evening, my wife was talking to me about how a coworker used an app to print off a crossword puzzle for everyone at work today. Since then, I keep getting facebook advertisements for "build your own crossword" apps. That should not be okay.

Hello everyone, happy Thanksgiving! I think it is important to note, as said in the discussion post description, that there will never be one simple solution for the border crisis. It is a complex issue that will indeed require multiple complex remedies over the course of many years. There are also different views on solutions. So, for example, when the Trump Administration was in office, there was a good amount of work conducted to secure borders and immigration improvements. However, when the Biden Administration came to office, the focus shifted from where President Trump thought the most work in immigration needed to what President Biden thought the most work was needed. It does not take much to presume that this will be the case until there is an extended amount of time with the same party in office. But when it comes to my 'elaborate' solutions to immigration and border security, an important aspect is that federal law enforcement agencies need the best possible visibility of who may be crossing the border. There have been promising trials showing that low-cost sensor and communications equipment such integrated fixed towers, remote video surveillance systems, tethered aerostats, dismounted radars, and others can get this done (Isacson, 2018). Aging, low-resolution cameras on the line should also be upgraded. This can also include border control officers to wear body cameras in order to ensure that everything is recorded as well as the interactions they will have with immigrants.  References: Isacson, A.

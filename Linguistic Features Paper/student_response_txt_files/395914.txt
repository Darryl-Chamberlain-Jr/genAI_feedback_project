Food Security White PaperTop of FormTop of FormTop of Form According to the United Nations Development Programme’s (1994) Human Development Report, food security includes not only the availability of food but also the physical and economic access to basic sustenance for all individuals. While global food production has seen an 18% increase in developing countries during the 1980s, reaching a point where the world can provide approximately 2,500 calories per person per day, the reality is that around 800 million people globally still face hunger (United Nations Development Programme [UNDP], 1994). To better understand these challenges, this paper provides an overview, drawing insights from case studies that discuss the dynamics of food security. This includes a global perspective examining the impact of conflict, climate variability, and economic downturns, a Malaysian case study focusing on sustainable household food security in the East Coast Economic Region (ECER), and a Nepalese case study introducing the "food well-being" approach to understand the paradox of increased food security but decreasing sustainability in small-scale agriculture (Alam et al., 2018; Gartaula et al., 2017). Globally, food security remains a challenge despite an overall increase in food production. Different factors such as conflict, climate variability, economic downturns, and the compounded impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic highlight the complexity of addressing malnutrition on a global scale (Food and Agriculture Organization [FAO], 2021). Examining specific case studies, the first investigation utilizes a cluster analysis approach to categorize developing countries based on agricultural factors, revealing distinct challenges influencing food security (Pawlak & Kołodziejczak, 2020). These challenges encompass issues such as the physical and economic unavailability of food in certain regions and social inequalities in nutrition in others (Pawlak & Kołodziejczak, 2020). The identified challenges in these regions include ensuring a secure and accessible food supply. In regard to household resilience factors in Malaysia, the case study identifies various elements and adaptation practices crucial for ensuring food security (Alam et al., 2018). The study emphasizes the importance of integrating food security programs with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and climate change adaptation initiatives (Alam et al., 2018). The challenges outlined in this case study highlight the vulnerability of households in the face of changing climatic conditions and highlight the need for adaptive strategies. The third case study, centered on Nepalese small-scale agriculture, introduces the innovative "food wellbeing" approach, integrating insights from food security, food sovereignty, and social wellbeing perspectives (Gartaula et al., 2017). This approach proves instrumental in understanding the paradox of increased food security coupled with decreasing sustainability (Gartaula et al., 2017). The study highlights the challenges posed by male out-migration, local off-farm work, and the erosion of local agricultural productivity and ecological sustainability (Gartaula et al., 2017). The implications of changing agrarian landscapes and the evolving status of women and lower-caste farmers showcase the challenges faced of the Nepalese agricultural sector (Gartaula et al., 2017). Together, these studies contribute to an understanding of a few different challenges associated with achieving food security. The challenges to food security are diverse, and influenced by external drivers that apply to different regions. Conflict disrupts food systems which can lead to displacement, reduce agricultural productivity, and restrict access to food resources (FAO et al., 2021). Climate variability introduces uncertainty in agricultural production, impacting crop yields and overall food availability (Alam et al., 2018). Economic downturns, exemplified by the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, contribute significantly to a surge in world hunger and affect almost all low- and middle-income countries (FAO et al., 2021). In Malaysia, household food security is linked with resilience factors and adaptation practices within the ECER. External drivers such as climate change impact household food security, bringing the need for adaptation strategies. This study emphasizes the importance of integrating food security programs with SDGs and climate change adaptation programs (Alam et al., 2018). In Nepal, the challenges faced by small-scale agriculture reveal the impact of external drivers on food security. Factors such as male out-migration, local off-farm work, and changing aspirations contribute to the erosion of local agricultural productivity and ecological sustainability (Gartaula et al., 2017). In summary, the external drivers of conflict, climate variability, and economic downturns affect food security on a global scale, while the case studies of Malaysia and Nepal illustrate the unique challenges faced by specific regions. Understanding these factors is crucial for developing interventions that address the distinct contexts of each region. To address global food security challenges, interventions at various governance levels play an important role in mitigating the impacts of external drivers. Maintaining conflict-sensitive food systems is critical for regions affected by conflicts, ensuring that immediate humanitarian assistance aligns with long-term development goals (FAO et al., 2021). This approach helps build resilience among the most vulnerable populations in conflict-affected areas. Climate-smart practices and environmental conservation are key strategies, especially in regions susceptible to climate variability. Adopting climate-smart and environmentally sound production techniques enhances the resilience of food systems against increased climate-related risks (FAO et al., 2021). In the Malaysian case study, the integration of food security programs with SDGs and climate change adaptation efforts shows the importance of aligning interventions with broader environmental objectives (Alam et al., 2018). The economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic emphasizes the need to keep food supply chains operational during economic downturns. Providing adequate support to the livelihoods of the most vulnerable, coupled with enhanced social protection programs, ensures continued production and access to nutritious foods (FAO et al., 2021). This response mechanism protects food security during periods of economic instability, as demonstrated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Addressing socio-economic inequalities is crucial for middle-income countries, where the negative impact of external drivers is magnified. Implementing policies that encompass agri-food, health, social protection, and environmental systems is imperative for systemic changes in food systems (FAO et al., 2021). Inclusive governance mechanisms, combined with access to technology and innovation, serve as accelerators for transforming food systems and making healthy diets more affordable (FAO et al., 2021). Systemic changes in food systems involve implementing an approach that considers the interconnectedness of various components. Policies and investments in agri-food, health, social protection, and environmental systems should be coherent and aligned to maximize positive impacts on food systems transformation (FAO et al., 2021). This strategy ensures that interventions are context-specific and address the diverse nature of global food security challenges. To address these challenges of global food security, a set of policy recommendations is gained from insights gleaned across case studies. Important among these is the idea to build resilience to major drivers, encompassing transformative measures that improve food systems against the escalating impacts of conflict, climate variability, and economic downturns. Conflict-sensitive food systems maintenance is vital for regions suffering from conflict, necessitating immediate humanitarian aid while aligning actions with long-term development goals (FAO et al., 2021). Additionally, integrating food security programs with SDGs is emphasized, as witnessed in the Malaysian case study, ensuring an efficient approach to addressing food security challenges (Alam et al., 2018). There is a need to address climate change mitigation, calling for the widespread adoption of climate-smart and environmentally sound production techniques, especially in vulnerable regions like Nepal. The need for broad policies and regulations resonates in these recommendations, emphasizing the need for systemic changes in agriculture, healthcare, social protection, and environmental systems. Inclusive governance and improved access to technology are essential tools in driving this process (FAO et al., 2021). Ultimately, these recommendations provide a framework for stakeholders to navigate the landscape of global food security. In summary, food security, defined by the UNDP in 1994, encompasses not only food availability but also consistent physical and economic access for all individuals. Despite a global increase in food production, nearly 800 million people face hunger due to challenges in equitable distribution and purchasing power. Case studies highlight global challenges and specific contexts in Malaysia and Nepal, emphasizing external drivers like conflict and climate variability. Interventions, ranging from conflict-sensitive food systems to inclusive governance are key. Policy recommendations exemplify the need for transformative measures and aligning food security programs with sustainability goals. Addressing global food security requires a context-specific approach, considering factors such as climate change. Overall, the journey to food security demands collaborative efforts, innovative strategies, and a commitment to addressing root causes, moving toward a world where everyone has consistent access to essential sustenance for a healthy life.

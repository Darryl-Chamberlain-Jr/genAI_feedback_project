 "Dec 7, 2023 3:36AM [name]  Risk communication is necessary as it provides real-time updates on information and direction between experts and the affected population (World Health Organization, 2023). Before the 2020 Beirut Blast, there was a failure in risk communication between government and military entities to report, examine, and safely store the hazardous cargo of ammonium nitrate that had been offloaded on the Port (Human Rights Watch, 2020). Since risk communication was not performed by the responsible entities, the moral implication of the failure to communicate meant that the agencies who had the authority to remove risk overlooked the risk. Ultimately, the Beruit Blast occurred in August 2020, killing 214 people (Humans Rights Watch, 2020).   In response to the blast, protests in Lebanon started which were aimed at the government for deceiving the public about the blast. Incredulity had been brewing in the Lebanese population for years leading up to the 2020 explosion, but it was the breaking of legal and ethical responsibilities in the blast, that led to these protests. Broken legal responsibilities occurred as soon as cargo was offloaded and officials in the Ministry of Public Works and Transport did not undertake their legal responsibility to communicate the hazard to Judiciary officials (Humans Rights Watch, 2020). In addition, a break in ethical responsibility occurred when Prime Minister Diab resigned a week after the explosion (Al Jazeera, 2023). Along with the massive death and injury toll, over 77,000 homes were destroyed which led to mass displacement of people (Humans Rights Watch, 2021). With much of the Prime Ministerâ€™s government resigning, people were left without direction in an overlapping disaster: COVID-19, the Beirut Blast, and economic depression.    Without clear and truthful information from the government or a subsequent investigation, the recovery phase has been stumped in growth. In the short term, protests took place that moved emergency resources away from survivors. Additionally, the lack of immediate (or still yet to occur), honest information from reliable sources meant that people turned to alternative sources to learn about the situation. People tend to want to hear from multiple sources to verify what they believe about a disaster situation before they act on that information (Centers for Disease Control, 2019, p. 4). This led to conspiracy theories spreading rapidly surrounding the cause of the Beirut Blast (Spring, 2020). In the long term, the lack of honest communication between the government and the people led to a decrease in trust in the system, and when an investigation into the cause of the blast finally was established, it was riddled with external interventions.     However, had risk communication existed between the government and military authorities, an emergency response plan could have been formed and shared with nearby emergency responders and citizens. Risk communication should have prioritized pre-incident relationship building between government entities and specialists. If communication had been established pre-incident, it may have been noticed that the ammonium nitrate was being stored against international guidance (near other explosive materials, in a poorly ventilated hangar, and in a densely populated area).

The quote that you selected truly highlighted the complexity involved in communication complications, especially within Emergency Management. The effects of risk communication are massive for all people involved. However, providing accurate information in an understandable (and believed) way to all people can be an extremely daunting undertaking. One of my favorite resources to use when considering how risk communication should take place to be most effective is 'Improving Public Messaging for Evacuation and Shelter in Place' by FEMA (https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/documents/fema_improving-public-messaging-for-evacuation-and-shelter-in-place_literature-review-report.pdf   Links to an external site.). The document provides concise statements regarding research surrounding emergency communication and the varying levels of risk communication efficiency. Although resources like this exist that provide general information on how to proceed with risk communication, no two disasters will be the same. Thus, emergency management/services authority figures must be willing to adapt to the disaster at hand.    -[name] from Module 8 Discussion: Ethics and Outcomes (AI Enhanced Assignment) Dec 9, 2023 11:58PM [name]  Hi [name],    Thank you so much for sharing this disaster! it is truly shocking to hear that there was such a large information gap between emergency response/services and Oxy Vinyls. I would be interested to learn why Norfolk Southern failed to share that information. It makes sense why many residents would have such a strong district in local government following that. According to American City and County, trust in local government is best built through accountability and transparency (Bell, 2022). Risk communication is central to building accountability and transparency through the means of telling people what is really happening and how the government is responding to it.

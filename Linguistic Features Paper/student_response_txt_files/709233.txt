There is a growing recognition that the natural environment can play a significant role in contributing to or causing political and economic destabilization within a country or region. It is projected that “by mid-century, 250 million people would become climate refugees, forced to permanently flee their homes and communities due to floods, droughts, hurricanes, and famines related to climate change” (Kelley et al., 2015). Climate change and its associated impacts, such as droughts, floods, and extreme weather events, can lead to food and water shortages, displacement of people, and social unrest. This, in turn, can create political instability and economic disruption as governments struggle to respond to the needs of their citizens and maintain social order. Similarly, resource scarcity, such as water or energy, can create tensions between separate groups, leading to conflicts and violence. Deforestation is one of the biggest drivers of climate change and involves clearing forests for agriculture, urbanization, and other purposes. It is reported that “the International Criminal Police Organization, or INTERPOL, estimates its worth at as much as US$100 billion annually and as up to 30 percent of all timber trade” (Bergenas & Knight, 2015). This has resulted in the emission of greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change. Moreover, deforestation has caused soil erosion, loss of biodiversity, and disturbances in local ecosystems. This has provided opportunities for illegal activities such as illegal logging, poaching, and drug trafficking. Deforestation can also lead to the displacement of local communities, who may have to move to other areas to find new sources of livelihood. This can cause political and social unrest and economic damage and fuel regional conflicts. The depletion of natural resources such as water and energy can also cause political and economic instability as these resources become increasingly scarce and valuable. Pollution is another significant environmental challenge that has negatively impacted the environment and human health. Pollution can take various forms, including air, water, and soil pollution. It has significantly impacted the environment by contributing to climate change and global warming. Additionally, pollution has led to air, water, and soil quality degradation, negatively affecting human health. It is estimated that “Crimes associated with black market fishing, illegal mining, timber trafficking, endangered animal poaching, and trafficking in hazardous waste or ozone-depleting materials are estimated as a US$200 billion annual industry “(Bergenas & Knight, 2015). Pollution has also provided opportunities for transnational crime, such as illegal dumping and trafficking of hazardous waste. These unlawful activities have far-reaching consequences, including social and political unrest, displacement of local communities, economic damage, and social instability. For instance, pollution can affect human health and cause economic damage, leading to social instability and political unrest. Political or economic destabilization in other parts of the world can have significant security implications for the United States. For example, suppose a country experiences political unrest due to environmental factors such as resource scarcity or pollution. In that case, it may result in a breakdown of law and order, leading to increased levels of violence, terrorism, and transnational crime. Such instability can also lead to the rise of extremist groups, which can threaten U.S. interests abroad and at home. Moreover, economic disruption caused by environmental factors can have severe implications for the global economy, affecting U.S. trade and investment interests. The displacement of people due to environmental factors can lead to mass migration, creating a refugee crisis that can destabilize neighboring countries and regions. This can also spread diseases and other health risks, affecting U.S. public health and national security. References Bergenas, J., & Knight, A. (2015).

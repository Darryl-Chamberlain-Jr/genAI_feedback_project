"The typical approach for me is that I limit sharing personal information on websites unless absolutely necessary and remain cautious about clicking unfamiliar links or downloading attachments from unknown sources. I stick to well-known and trusted websites whenever possible, especially for transactions involving sensitive data such as online banking or shopping. The philosophy of "if I don't need to share it, I won't" guides my online interactions. This reduces the amount of personal information floating around that could be potentially misused. At home, there always has to be safeguards. I use complex, unique passwords for each of my accounts and store them in a secure password manager. Whenever possible, I enable Two-Factor Authentication for an extra layer of protection for critical accounts like email and banking. I promptly install operating system updates (Typically use automated updates and review them), software patches, and antivirus/anti-malware updates to fix known security vulnerabilities. I ensure the firewalls on my devices (both computer and router) are active and properly configured as needed. When utilizing public networks, I activate my Virtual Private Network (VPN) to encrypt my traffic. With at-home Wi-Fi, I replace the router's default admin credentials with a strong, unique combination. I use WPA3 encryption for my Wi-Fi network, making it much harder for someone to crack the password. While not foolproof, I enable MAC address filtering for extra control over which devices are allowed to connect to my network." "Hello [name], I'd still recommend additional security software. Even the latest updates can't always protect against unknown threats, and antivirus programs catch what might slip through the cracks. Plus, they offer features like firewalls and password managers for all-around protection. Many antivirus options work on Macs and iPhones â€“ consider doing some research and trying a free trial to see if it's a good fit for you!" "Hello [name], While VPNs are useful, be selective about which one you use. Some free VPNs actually put your privacy at risk. It's also important to have strong passwords and enable two-factor authentication on important accounts. Make sure your home router (whether you own it or it's provided by your housing) has a strong password and that its firmware is up-to-date. Vulnerable routers are easy targets for hackers."

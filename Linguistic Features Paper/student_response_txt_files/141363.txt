"Hi Class, When it comes to staying safe online and protecting our devices, a couple simple steps can go a long way. Personally, I make sure to always do the following: Online Privacy: It's important to be mindful of what we share online and adjust our privacy settings accordingly. For example, avoiding sharing personal information like our full address or phone number publicly on social media can help keep us safe from prying eyes. Never share where you are in that exact moment wait until later. Device Security: Just like we lock our doors at home, keeping our devices secure is essential. Using antivirus software and keeping it updated is like having a digital lock on our computer, keeping out unwanted intruders. I have two-factor authentication enabled for all my social media, banking accounts and email. By being cautious about what we share online and taking steps to secure our devices, we can better protect our privacy and stay safe in the digital world. It's all about simple but effective measures that help keep us secure online." "Yes snapchat can be scary forsure. I asked the Snapchat AI the same thing and it was honestly so scary. WhatsApp is also a great alternative for texting as it is also end-to-end encrypted. Using a VPN is great idea, I'm going to start using one on my MacBook as well. Thank you for the tips and great post!!" "Yes before this class, I've also never really paid close attention to protecting myself online. Thank you for sharing your insights! Using a VPN and HTTPS websites is a very smart choice, I personally don't utilize them but will look further into it as we progress with technological advancements we can't risk compromising our information. Great post!!

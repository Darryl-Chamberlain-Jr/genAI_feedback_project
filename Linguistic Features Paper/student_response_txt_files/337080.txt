"For the most part, I've been using my hot spot function on my phone to connect to the internet, so security-wise I rely on Verizon and Apple to keep me safe. My hotspot is only accessible by password and I seldom use public wifi, unless I absolutely need to or my hotspot bandwidth runs out. My router at home protects us by use of 2 different wifi passwords as well. other than that I am pretty terrible at even thinking about it at all to be quite honest. To keep myself safe online, I change my passwords often and keep almost every social media profile private. However, thinking throughout the week I realize I need to be more cognizant of my privacy and security especially since I rely so heavily on the auto password functions on almost all my devices and internet accounts. I'm definitely learning alot more than I have prior to enrolling in the course, and will be applying more stringent practices to my devices." "Prior to the course I too have been pretty relaxed about my security measures in regard to my home router, but now I'm more aware and will be applying stricter security on all my devices as well. The 2-factor authentication is a great tool to implement to ensure strong security measures" "It's great that you don't click random links everywhere. The company I work for sends out phishing emails every so often to ensure security measures are being practiced. If you end up clicking a link within an email, you get tasked with having to complete a death by PowerPoint security class"

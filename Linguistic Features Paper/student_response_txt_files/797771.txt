"I can honestly say that my online security practices are lacking. While my electronic devices are not vulnerable to a cyber attack, I probably need to find ways to beef up my security level. At home, I have a Netgear router. The router is connected to the Xfinity network through an ethernet cable. I don’t know if have any router security, but I also didn’t realize I could mess with the router security settings either. My laptop and phone are both protected with Norton anti-virus software. I use the scan function to scan the devices for any possible threats, check that my internet connection is secure, and any internal issues that need to be addressed. Norton does have a VPN feature, which I rarely use. When I do use a VPN, it is when I go on deployment. However, I don’t use Norton for a VPN. Instead, I use other VPN services that I know are good at tricking streaming services into thinking I’m in the US when I’m not. Other than the security measures described above, I’m nonchalant when it comes to online security. After I finished typing up my meager measures of security, it made me realize I should probably consider beefing up my cyber security practices with useful practices like using a VPN all of the time instead of only on deployment." "[name], great discussion post! I agree with all of your cyber security practices. I do try to avoid public Wi-Fi as well. However, when I’m at the commissary or exchange where my cellphone signal is weak, I utilize the Wi-Fi hotspot in the stores. I trust the hotspot because I know Wi-Fi on base needs to be secure enough for military members to use. Do you think the commissary/exchange Wifi is trustworthy or would you rather not use it at all?" "[name], excellent discussion post! I also use Norton for anti-virus protection on my laptop and phone. My internet provider is Xfinity. For some odd reason, I don’t seem to have the option to look at the devices connected to my Wi-Fi. I might have found a hole in my internet security that needs fixing. I also agree with your other cyber security practices. For people who are new to cyber security, what do you think is the most important thing to have in terms of protection?"

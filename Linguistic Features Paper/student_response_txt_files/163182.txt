	A national security system reliant on electrical energy poses several challenges for energy policy. Utilizing this type of system can make critical infrastructure vulnerable to physical and cyber-attacks. Transitioning to an energy-reliant system can be volatile and disjointed affairs, characterized by competing interests and stop-go policies (IEA 2021). Many places in the world depend on natural gas and fossil fuels as primary source for infrastructures in their everyday lives; going electric raises question of their future (IEA 2021). The use of natural gas and fossil fuels can contribute to climate change, pollution, and resource depletion; addressing these topics can pose threats to national security. Prioritizing and addressing these challenges can be beneficial to finding cleaner and more sustainable electrical energy sources.  Electrical grids will have to be enhanced to meet new requirements of full electric. This can be accomplished by investing in grid technologies, improving cybersecurity protocols, and diversifying energy sources. Consequences from these grids failing, due to natural disasters or attacks, can compromise national security. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has announced $34 million for projects to strengthen and modernize aging power grids throughout the nation (Energy 2024). The United States and its allies rely heavily on energy infrastructures, such as pipelines, national defense and so forth.  This over-reliance of electricity as a primary source of energy, can lead to significant homeland security challenges among all nations. In order to combat this challenge and mitigate future problems, energy sources must be diversified and not have a single grid as the “main source”. The diversity of supply that can be applied, can improve reliability by eliminating single-point failures (CNA Military Advisory Board 2015). Another issue is nations may and will compete for reliable electrical energy sources which can lead to conflicts and tensions between nations. Having an electrical-reliant national security system can be both beneficial and disadvantageous. It is beneficial by allowing the U.S. and it allies to move away from natural gas and fossil fuels. This in term can get participating nations to use a cleaner and sustainable source of electrical energy that can be applied to various infrastructures. It can also be disadvantageous, due to current limited sources of reliable and sustainable electrical energy yet to be discovered. If not diversified, it can make any infrastructure that is solely electrical-reliant become vulnerable to partial or complete failure due to natural disasters or terrorist attacks for example.

Hey everyone, I'll be doing Q4. Find R and \theta given the components Rx=-0.271 and Ry=6.624 The student did everything correctly all the way through from finding R by using the Pythagorean Theorem getting 6.6185, and finding \theta by using \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{y}{x}\right) and getting an angle of 87.66^{\circ}. The mistake was subtracting \theta from 360 as if were in the fourth quadrant. Because the triangle is located in the second quadrant, \theta should be subtracted from 180, giving us \theta=92.34^{\circ} Hope ya'll are having a great week so far. [name]

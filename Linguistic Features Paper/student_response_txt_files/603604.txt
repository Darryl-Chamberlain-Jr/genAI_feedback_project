The United States has an over-reliance on the energy sector, and this threatens national security. The impetus for this predicament is the centralization of the power grid and maintenance, rather than innovation of the present infrastructure (CNA Military Advisory Board, 2015). Water and sewage systems are powered through electrically powered control systems (CNA Military Advisory Board, 2015). Further, every aspect of our daily lives is facilitated by the energy sector. Communication is largely digital, records and important information are actively stored on servers, transportation controls require power, even life saving services are reliant on the energy sector (CNA Military Advisory Board, 2015). There are secondary energy supply considerations that are delegated to the both the supplier and the consumer (businesses), but these generators often only have enough provisions for a few days’ worth of output (CNA Military Advisory Board, 2015).   	The military, as like any function of U.S. society, is also dependent on the energy sector. In many ways, the military’s reliance on the energy sector has some of the gravest impacts, should the infrastructure fail to provide electricity. For instance, the many U.S. military installations connected to the power grid would lose the ability to provide critical 24/7 watch with early warning systems (CNA Military Advisory Board, 2015). Additionally, sustained power outages would impact the lives of military members and their families, which could result in distractions that impact mission readiness (CNA Military Advisory Board, 2015). Finally, due to remote sensing operations, the impacts of domestic power outages could mean that allies suffer a lack in overwatch (CNA Military Advisory Board, 2015). It is clear, then, that the United States needs to improve its energy security. The need for energy to supply security often combats the acknowledged existence of climate change. These competing interests make it so that, while the two can be discussed upon simultaneously, the solution is two unique approaches (Toke & Vezirgiannidou, 2013). The U.S. has a habit of prioritizing affordability over sustainability (Toke & Vezirgiannidou, 2013). This manifests into a delaying action of embracing sustainable energy practice. Such delays further strain the revitalization of the energy sector.  Although the U.S. military has leaned into developing micro-grids for energy needs, there remains a high reliance on fossil fuels to provide sustained energy (CNA Military Advisory Board, 2015).  As such, unless there is larger momentum at the highest levels of governance, the problem shall persist. The U.S. reluctance in overhauling its present system can be combated through incremental changes. The CNA Military Advisory Board (2015) provides solutions like innovating the infrastructure as repairs are necessary and developing policies that would permeate all levels of government. The government needs to take a chance on implementing these new ideas, because the current infrastructure is highly exploitable through cyber and physical attacks (CNA Military Advisory Board, 2015). If the U.S wants to preserve national security, then adopting proactive measures to the energy sector is a must.  References CNA Military Advisory Board. (2015).

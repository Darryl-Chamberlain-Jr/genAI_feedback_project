"Privacy on the internet is a myth. So many programs, websites, and computer companies (i.e. Apple and Microsoft) keep, sell, and use our data for many reasons. Users who use private browsers or incognito mode are often unaware that their internet provider often tracks their search and website history. While many of the companies monitor our data for seemingly harmless reasons, the security of users' data and Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is easy to hack into. When you get a text from unknown numbers it is likely a result of an online data leak. What really worries me is that identity theft is so easy to fall victim to in the age of technology. With social media, online banking, and other internet activities, our credit card numbers, phone numbers, and addresses are easy pickings for malicious users who wish to steal data. All of our internet use is tracked and monitored at all times. Internet privacy is non-existent in this day and age." "Avoiding public networks is one of the most effective ways to avoid having information stolen from your device. It seems so many people don't think of the potential dangers of utilizing public networks. When I'm in public I rarely even use my phone, but if I have to I use my own network with a VPN." "Great Post! I agree with you. Public networks are sketchy. You never know who is watching them and pulling information from them. A VPN is a great way to prevent IP tracking. Common sense is another great security measure. If an app, text, or email doesn't seem right, it probably isn't right."

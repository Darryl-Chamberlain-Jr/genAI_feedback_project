An electricity reliant national security system can pose many challenges for energy policy. Firstly, it is difficult to enact changes in energy policy because electricity is so widely used. Additionally, if the country’s national security system only runs on electricity, that poses an extreme national security risk in the event of a national power outage. A country’s national electricity system can also be vulnerable to attacks from adversarial countries or terrorists. Specific to the United States, the electricity grid is run on a significant amount of aging technology that is more susceptible to attack, accidents, or weather events (The Center for Naval Analyses [CNA], 2015). Another problem caused by energy overreliance is the process of acquiring this energy and where it is acquired from. For example, the United States has imported fossil fuels from hostile regions in the Middle East and countries in the European Union have been over reliant on Russian gas (Toke & Vezirgiannidou, 2013). In both of these examples, the nation or group who is selling the gas or fuel has a significant advantage over the countries they are selling to. In these cases, those who are at the disadvantage are the United States and its allies. Therefore, it is necessary to strive for energy independence. These hostile countries could withhold their energy resource from the United States and its allies and it would cause an extreme power imbalance and cause significant disruptions in all affected countries.

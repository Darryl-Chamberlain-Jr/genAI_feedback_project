Having access to food is a basic necessity, however, it is not something that everyone has access to. Having access to affordable, nutritious, sustainable food is fundamental to growth, development, and survival. Food insecurity is a global crisis with millions of people facing hunger. Throwing caution to the wind when dealing with food insecurity leaves people vulnerable to malnutrition, health risks, and eventually death. The concept of human security sees food as a fundamental right simply because human development and sustainability relies on it. Food is fuel. Without it, society dies a slow, cruel death. A big part of that cruelty lies in the fact that often people are not going hungry because there is not enough food, but rather because they cannot afford it. The greed of companies would rather people starve to death, than make food more affordable. “Although nature can create local food shortages, human beings turn these shortages into widespread famine” sums up the way that companies are able to drive up prices of food due to simple supply and demand that exacerbate catastrophic famine (UNDP, 1994). People are forced into food insecurity by inequality. The consequences of food insecurity do not rest with people simply experiencing hunger aches. Not having adequate food leads to things like growth being stunted in children, low productivity in adults, malnutrition, and inability to carry children to term. Children who do not have access to food are not able to reach developmental milestones (UNDP, 1994). In the same world where people are starving to death, there are other parts of the world where there is so much food waste that it could otherwise supplement the hunger found another community. Growing up hearing things like “there are children in Africa starving” from parents trying to get their children to eat their meal brings to mind that hunger is a secluded issue, when the reality is that it affects various regions in the world, including the United States of America. Low and middle-income countries such as the ones located in Africa and Asia are affected the most by economic driven hunger (FAO et al, 2021). Even with majority of poor people’s income being spent on food according to the World Bank (2012), it still is not enough to escape hunger (Alam et al, 2018). Inequality tends to drive food insecurity.  Interventions can help bridge the gap and reduce food insecurity. In Nepal, an approach was used to help negate various aspects of food insecurity by targeting agriculture, off-farm livelihood opportunities, and women’s well-being to address the social factors that contribute to food insecurity in the Kaski district (Gartaula et al, 2017). Increasing the amount of money circulating in the area helped the people living there to afford the food that was being produced. The impact that this intervention had on the area was seen in the decrease of underweight children, decreased stunting in children, and increased life expectancy (Gartaula et al, 2017). Since supply and demand has the potential to increase food prices, increasing supply should in theory reduce the pricing of food, especially when there is a surplus. Agricultural intervention that helps increase the amount of food available helps the community by not only maintaining the minimum requirement, but also using methods to increase the production rate that keep up with population growth. Using technology, knowledge and adaptability to increase food strategies that account for climate change and population growth is crucial to combating food insecurity, as seen in Malaysia to improve resilience factors and adaptation practices using the ECER Development project (Alma et al, 2018). Adapting is the only way to overcome the food insecurity seen around the world.  A policy recommendation that would be beneficial is to increase food production to drive down pricing for food and make it more affordable. This intervention could work because it serves to keep up with the growing population while also keeping the options that are available accessible. Low productivity, inefficient food supply chains, and affordable healthy diets help to keep poor communities from obtaining food security, so disrupting that will be the best way to ignite change (Alma et al, 2018). Increasing food availability, access, and utilization will help the chance for sustainability and human development moving forward. The agriculture sector plays a crucial role in improving the availability of food security, so creating a policy recommendation that starts with them makes the most sense (Pawlak and Kolodziejczak, 2020). Ending world hunger starts with getting more food on tables.   References Alam, M. M., Wahid, A. N. M., & Siwar, C. (2018).

Humans are the single greatest contributing factor to climate change. We all have wants for all sorts of products to help us along in our daily lives and we often make choices that negatively impact the environment. The three most detrimental ways we have contributed to impacting environmental systems that have caused rising levels of transnational crime are our inability to make human rights centered decisions, continuing to contribute massive amounts of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere and ineffective policies resulting in conflicts of land resources.    The inability to make human rights centered decisions forces individuals to go into survival mode to protect their families from food insecurity, water scarcity, poverty, health concerns, displacement from their homes and potential conflict within their own communities because of other individuals fighting for the same things. This turns the families seeking protection to find whatever protection they can, including transnational crime organizations that can meet and/or exceed their needs. This allows the crime organizations to gain popularity by showing favor to the people in the areas being more negatively affected by climate change. As criminal organizations rise, there are increases in revenue loss, increases in crime being committed across multiple borders (i.e., the United States and Mexico border that is faced with a drug war happening on both sides of the border).   We humans continue to contribute significant amounts of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere from various causes like transportation, deforestation, and agriculture. Deforestation from illegal logging has direct connections with transnational crime, corruption, and environmental degradation (Bergenas & Knight, 2015). Major producers of timber products like Peru, Brazil, Indonesia, and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) are all examples of countries affected by illegal deforestation. Not only does deforestation contribute to the emissions of greenhouse gases and have connections to transnational crime, but it also has increased the exploitation of the indigenous communities through forced labor and other means. The illegal logging industry negatively impacts the immediate areas where it is taking place and the revenues from illegal sales fund various groups like the terrorist group al-Shabaab in Somalia, militias in the eastern DRC and gangs in Peru (Bergenas & Knight, 2015). As cited in INTERPOL’s Project leaf (2015), the estimates for what the illegal logging industry is worth within the world are as much as $100 billion USD annually and constitutes 30 percent of all timber trade (Bergenas & Knight, 2015). That is $100 billion USD lost to transnational crime organizations each year that allows for the continued growth of those crime syndicates while continuing to massively impact the environment.    The last of the three most detrimental ways we humans contribute to impacting environmental systems and contributing to the rise of transnational crime organizations is by creating policies that are ineffective because they are simply not followed, or they are “overlooked” by individuals within positions of power because of corruption. For example, the DRC is well known worldwide because of the conflict minerals which are mined within its borders. In April 2022, the Environment Ministry within the DRC released an audit by the General Inspectorate of Finance, dated May 2021, that revealed at least six former minsters granted illegal logging permits in violation of a nationwide moratorium and in July 2022, the DRC government launched a massive auction for licensing rights to 30 different locations within the DRC rainforest for drilling to begin for oil and gas (HRW, 2023). This continued disregard for adhering to government policies and continued disregard for the environment by releasing mineral rights to a section of land that could release massive amounts of greenhouse gas emissions show the continued effects of transnational crime. They do this by leading various governments, normally those of developing countries, to destabilize by continuing to force corruption and the creation of policies that allow for the continued deforestation of another major rainforest. This creates an avenue for revenue to escape from the countries where the illicit activities are taking place which removes the opportunity for that country to use those revenues to better the health, food security, and water security of its population. Those revenues are then used to continue to fund the activities of transnational criminal organizations like al-Qaeda, ISIS, and the Mexican drug Cartels as well as many other organizations around the world. The United States continues to feel increased pressure from transnational criminal organizations as its southern and norther borders are constantly bombarded with all sorts of trafficking from drug to human to sex trafficking. That pressure will only increase as those criminal organizations continue to obtain funds from the revenues they make from illegal fishing, illegal logging, conflict mineral sales and poaching of endangered species. This pressure will be compounded by the effects of climate change from the release of greenhouse gas emissions as the Earth continues to warm and people search for any means necessary to protect themselves as well as their families from the impacts of climate change.

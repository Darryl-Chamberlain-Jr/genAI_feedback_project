"Hi class, When it comes to safeguarding my information while on the internet admittedly, I don't take as much caution when I am at home as I should, as far as I know, my router is set up with the basic security settings that were included with the package we purchased, that includes a firewall. I do, however, use a VPN that I pay a subscription on whenever using a public network outside my home. Besides that, I pay close attention to the HTTP and ensure that whenever I am putting private information in, that it is on an HTTPS, and stays that way the entire time. I also do everything in my power to be vigilant about what links I click and keep a close eye out for any ads that may try and disguise itself as the link I am looking for. I also try and pay attention to the address of the websites I am looking for incase the address may have some subtle variations that may be a facade of a trusted site. This class has given the inspiration to look into more security while on the internet." "Congrats on the coming of your baby girl! You defiantly start really thinking about the potential dangers that are out in the world once children are in the picture. There is a lot that I try and stay vigilant about with the internet and my boys. Especially being so young they could easily be susceptible to all matters of privacy invasion. I also use a VPN, and I find that it is really a worthwhile investment. Especially out in public, in a MCCS facility, they often time have poor data coverage and you are forced to get on their public Wi-Fi, but once you log on, you can see the amount of other people on the network as well. Having that VPN really does help put your mind at ease." "I have never considered disconnecting the devices that I no longer use but it makes sense. I do however also practice not syncing all of my information but that may be more out of laziness rather that safeguarding! One thing I have always been adamant on is not sharing my location when it is avoidable. It never felt right to me to let Facebook know exactly where I was all the time.

Here is the next student submission: This has been a very interesting module and I have learned many new things. The first thing I would say that amazed me is how advanced artificial intelligence was. Before this module I had never interacted with it. The program seemed to have answers to my questions right away and went in more depth than what I had asked to begin with. It is definitely something that will change how we handle technology in the future. Although as far as the most significant in recent times I believe would be the invention of the internet. It has greatly improved how we can talk to each other. You can meet new people online with common interests. Businesses can have video presentations anywhere in the world. This allows each member to physically see any issues or plans that can affect the future of the company. This also has helped to boost the economy by allowing companies to branch out to international locations. I believe emails can be associated with predecessors such as letters in the mail. Although I see things like a video conference to be a stand-alone thing not comparable to the past. The closest I could say to this would be prerecorded films sent to each other, but it lacks the live aspect. When the video is live it allows questions to be asked. This has been a very interesting module and allowed me to learn new aspects of modern technology.

The United States border has experienced increased traversal, complexity, and notoriety as America faces the first quarter of the 21st century. The issues facing policymakers and border security authorities are myriad and challenging. Weapons & narcotics smuggling, human trafficking, the increase in women and children migrants, and the diversifying nationality of migrants are all issues that must be addressed.    Weapons & Narcotics Smuggling: The movement of drugs and firearms across the U.S. and Mexico border is a timeless business, yet the lethality and quantity of both have increased. Fentanyl was first seized in 2014, but only 10kg in one seizure. In 2022, 8,400kg of Fentanyl was taken on the southern border (Reuters, n.d.). While dangerous narcotics have increased their frequency of entering the United States, hazardous weapons have transferred the other way: south. Between 2014 and 2018, an estimated 70% of firearms seized in Mexico and submitted for source tracing originated in the United States (GAO, 2021). An increase in the number of task forces and highly trained federal 1811 special agents assigned to firearm and narcotic interdiction would be an effective resolution. Between 2015-2017, task forces seized over 1,000 weapons at the border. During that time, less well-trained CBP agents only took an average of 115 firearms annually. If special agents can seize five times as many weapons annually with significantly less staffing, additional resources should be sent toward those initiatives instead of to generic CBP agents.    Human Trafficking: Humans have been smuggled back and forth across the border since the Border Patrol began in the 1920s. Similarly to material trafficking, human trafficking has increased in lethality and quantity. Two thousand seven hundred sixty-two people were charged with human trafficking offenses in 2014. In 2021, that number increased to 5,046 defendants (Jordan, 2022). The change from lone traffickers to syndicated cartel migration business around 2019 has also increased the number of trafficked humans and the number of deaths. The human trafficking business has increased from $500 million in 2018 to $13 billion today (Jordan, 2022).  Not distinct from item trafficking, human trafficking deterrence, and detection are more effective with better-trained enforcement. “Border personnel has used increased resources to initiate more prosecutions of first-time illegal entrants, diverting resources away from trafficking” (York, 2022). More special agents, who prove to be more effective than border patrol agents, would be beneficial to reducing human trafficking.    Increase in Family Migration: Over the last few decades, Customs and Border Protection predominantly detained single migrants at the southern border. Now, the demographic has been increasingly shifting to families traveling together. “There were 87,000 apprehensions of Mexican family units in FY 2023—more than the total number of Mexican families encountered from 2016 through 2022” (Putzel-Kavanaugh & Ruiz Soto, 2023).  While CBP has had to restructure detention housing and procedures for migrant families, the capabilities that immigrant children bring to the United States are numerous. “Immigrants and U.S.-born children of immigrants represented 85 percent of all Asian-American and Pacific Islander [college] students, and 63 percent of Latino [college] students in 2018”(Jordan, 2020).    Diversifying Nationality of Migrants: While migration twenty years ago was conducted primarily by Mexican nationals, the national origin of immigrants has changed dramatically as well, as displayed by the following fiscal year 2023 chart: [CHART] (Putzel-Kavanaugh & Ruiz Soto, 2023) While the diverse nationality of migrants is a new challenge, it can be addressed. Triage by home nationality is one way for CBP to facilitate efficient entry and deportation. It also allows subjects from nations like Afghanistan to receive priority status to enter the United States to ensure their safety.    References Fentanyl. (2023, August 9).

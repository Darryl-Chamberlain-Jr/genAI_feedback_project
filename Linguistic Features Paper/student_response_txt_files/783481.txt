"The internet is everywhere. From coffee shops, to airports, to restaurants, you can usually always find an internet connection. This is great for everyone to have the ability to stay connected, but you also run the risk of leaking your private information or someone hacking into your devices. My work requires me to travel quite a bit so I am constantly hopping on different networks to catch up on work or log in for homework assignments. To protect my privacy online, I always ensure I use the highest level of authentication possible for any login. For websites, I will always use a two factor authentication to login. I ensure my passwords are very unique and not the same for each site I use. I always ensure to keep my authentication methods up to date as well. As for safeguarding my devices, I use antivirus software on my personal computers. I also have a unique password set and an encryption, WIFI protected access (WPA), for my at home WIFI. For work, I use a remote VPN before accessing anything online to ensure I am protecting the information being held within the computer. Bottom line, I always choose the highest level of protection possible for whatever website or device I am using." I completely agree with you on this class giving me some inspiration to look more into what I am doing for internet protection. I am very na√Øve when it comes to information leaks and hacking because it hasn't happened to me. I would hope this is a result of me being careful of sites I visit and my protection currently in place! Just looking at this discussion, I didn't know so many people use a personal VPN for their personal computers. It is a really great idea that I never thought of doing. Great post! "You seem to be more cautious than I am! It is a very smart idea to invest in a personal VPN due to how much you find yourself connecting to a public network. I just connect without a second thought about my information getting hacked. I like how you keep it simple it home, but your simple is better than mine! Having a password you can't remember might be a good thing as long as you don't lose it. Also, having the idea to install a third party firmware only makes it more secure. I'm sure if you are unlucky when it comes to hacking you have found the best tricks to keep a high level of protection!"

 "Dec 3, 2023 9:23PM [name]  Class,   As a reminder, the disaster I picked at the beginning of this course was the Robb Elementary School shooting that took place in Uvalde Texas. I will now attempt to answer the questions that were posted in this week’s discussion assignment.   Discuss the moral implications of risk communication   Moral and ethical implications within risk and crisis communications are of the utmost importance.  They are something that needs to be considered during the creation and implementation of a crisis communication plan to help ensure that the emotions of a crisis or disaster do not lead to immoral or unethical crisis communication decisions being made (Ingram & Ingram, 2018). This is especially true during a disaster or crisis where emotions may be running at an all-time high, such as that of an elementary school shooting.   When creating or delivering crisis or disaster communication messages in response to something extraordinarily tragic, such as an elementary school shooting, it is important to ensure that emotions are not allowing for unethical or immoral decisions to be made. For instance, it may feel necessary or warranted to release the home address of the shooter once it is known but this may be a very unethical decision that can lead to even more issues potentially. These issues include the family of the shooter receiving threats, getting harassed, or evening sustaining damage to their home or injuries because of public anger.   Identify situations in which ethical/legal responsibilities were broken.   The best example I can find where ethical or legal responsibilities were broken regarding the Robb Elementary School shooting in Uvalde Texas, would be how inaccurate information was reported multiple times.  For instance, Spathe (2022) informs us that officials first claimed that after breaking through the door, police "engaged the active shooter" and "continued to keep him pinned down" in the classroom next door, where the gunman had entered "until a tactical team could be put together." Officers then shot and killed the attacker. This was mostly inaccurate and simply not true.  The want/need to get information out as quickly as possible to the public when they are demanding it can sometimes lead to making the unethical decision of rushing information, as opposed to being patient and ensuring that what is about to be said is factual.   Consider what happened in the situation, and the short and long-term effects.   The unethical decision of providing information before it had a chance to be confirmed or fact-checked merely to get information out quickly had short-term and long-term effects and consequences.  In the short term, it led to public confusion and misconceptions about what happened during the event and how the event actually unfolded.  This may have led to the public sharing incorrect information as well leading to mass confusion and “chaos”.  This is why it is incredibly important that when it comes to a disaster, crisis, or pandemic, the information that is being reported is confirmed and factual before it is reported or posted.  The long-term effects or consequences include the public having a disbelief or mistrust in the information that is sometimes provided simply because they now have a personal experience of information being incorrect in their history.   How Might these effects be mitigated in a future situation (i.e., what could have been done better).   The most obvious answer on how to mitigate the unethical actions of reporting or posting inaccurate information during a crisis, disaster, or pandemic is to ensure that you are not reporting or posting inaccurate information.  This can be accomplished in two different ways.  One is to be patient, and simply not report anything yet because the facts have not been confirmed or determined.  The second is to research and confirm with other sources that the information you are about to report, or post is, in fact, true. By doing this, many of the effects and consequences mentioned in the previous paragraph should be eliminated.   [name]   References   Ingram, E., & Ingram, E. (2018, November 26).

I think you had a particularly interesting crisis when it comes to the legal and moral implications of crisis communications.  Because COVID was so "new" so to speak there was such a demand for information.  I feel that this sometimes led to people publishing or reporting anything they could simply to keep pushing information out, regardless if the information they were putting out was helpful, true, or accurate.  Great work!   [name] from Module 8 Discussion: Ethics and Outcomes (AI Enhanced Assignment) Dec 6, 2023 9:30PM Thomas Donnan   [name],   Great job with your discussion post assignment for this week, I thought it was really great.  You did a really good job discussing the legal and moral implications of decisions that were made regarding the Texas power grid outage.  More specifically, when you discussed how the Electric Reliability Company of Texas (ERCOT) chose profits instead of investing in weatherization as recommended.  This to me, clearly sounds like an unethical decision was made. Money oftentimes seems to be at the root of making unethical decisions, and apparently, in this scenario, it is no different. Hopefully, the can learn form these mistakes and use it to make better more ethical decisions in the future.  Great work.   [name]"

Here is the next student submission: In this module, I was astounded to discover the vast landscape of Generative AI (GenAI) platforms that I was previously unaware of. While I had heard of ChatGPT, I had never fully explored its potential. I tried out Google's GeminiAI, which offered a unique user experience. The amount of information provided by these platforms proved invaluable, propelling me towards completion of my assignment. I would try it out again to test out other features that it has to offer. One communication technology that was covered in this module that is the most significant in human history is ChatGPT in my opinion. From reading a few articles about ChatGPT one example is ChatGPT which is very good at having conversations that seem real and writing different kinds of creative texts. This has made people even more interested in studying and building natural language processing systems, which has led to new ideas and even better ways to do things. Most digital communication technologies can be seen as both completely new and updated versions of the analog technologies they replaced. It all depends on how you look at and use them. Since technologies have changed how we communicate. They allow us to connect with people instantly, no matter where they are. We can also share information and ideas easily with each other, even if we're not in the same place at the same time. These technologies have become a part of our everyday lives and have changed the way we interact with each other. This module helped me understand a lot about GenAI so I don't have any questions left unanswered.

"May 2 155 Total Words Hey Class, My approach to protecting my devices is to stay away from the unknown. I do not connect to public Wi-Fi unless I'm in incognito mode, and I have different passwords for all my websites and a second verification for my logins. I stay awake from websites that might pose a potential risk to my devices>at work. I Watch out for links and attachments from unknown emails and report them to the cybersecurity team when they come up. I use McAfee anti-virus software on my laptop, I keep updated regularly, and I scan my computer for malware on a regular basis. My router at home encrypted the network, and I have it set to WPA3 and turned on automatic updates. When guests come over, they have a Guest password, so they cannot access my network. By following these simple I keep my information safe and ensure that my devices do not get compromised" "May 5 Hey [name], I do respect your common sense approach to internet security, but it is essential to still protect your devices in this day and age; there are so many risks attached to not protecting your devices and possibly having you personal information leaked" "May 5 Hey [name], Thanks for the very informative post. I definitely agree with the use of VPNâ€™s. Usually, when I tell my friends the importance of using one, they look at me like some madman, but I explain to them that their livelihood could probably be at stake and how they usually get on board."

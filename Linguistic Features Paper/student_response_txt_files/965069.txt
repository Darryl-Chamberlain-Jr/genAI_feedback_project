In the late twentieth century, multilateral diplomacy gained significance, particularly within international organizations like the United Nations (UN) (Onuma, 2017). The UN, acknowledged as the most universal and legitimate institution, hosts essential forums such as the UN General Assembly and Security Council (UNSC), facilitating member states to exchange information and viewpoints on global relations (Onuma, 2017). Member states utilize these platforms to address conflicts through negotiation, diplomacy, and mediation, often resulting in UN resolutions (Onuma, 2017). Despite the UN's commitment to the shared interests of the international community, some states resist UN involvement in their internal affairs. Over time, the line between domestic and international issues has blurred, allowing the UN to intervene through various means, including resolutions and coercive actions (Onuma, 2017). The Security Council, authorized to use force if necessary, plays a pivotal role in conflict resolution (Onuma, 2017). The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) operates under Chapter VI of the UN Charter, allowing the use of force primarily for self-defense (Humud, 2022). Addressing conflicts in Lebanon involves legal tools like UNSC resolutions (Humud, 2022). A significant resolution, UNSC Resolution 1559 in 2004, called for the withdrawal of foreign forces and disarmament of militias, specifically addressing the presence of Syrian forces in Lebanon (Humud, 2022). UNSC Resolution 1701 was instrumental in the aftermath of the 2006 Lebanon War, urging a cessation of hostilities and emphasizing Lebanon's sovereignty (Humud, 2022). Additionally, UNSC Resolution 1680 in 2006 reaffirmed Resolution 1559, expressing concern about ongoing violence and urging the full implementation of its provisions (Humud, 2022). Implementing these legal instruments involves diplomatic efforts, negotiations, and international cooperation (Humud, 2022). Stakeholders, including the involved parties and the global community, engage in dialogue to encourage resolution compliance. In Lebanon, realizing these resolutions necessitates collaboration from the Lebanese government, regional actors, and international organizations like the UN (Humud, 2022). In August 2023, the UNSC extended the UNIFIL mandate until August 31, 2024, through Resolution 2695 (United Nations [UN], 2023). Emphasizing UNIFIL's crucial role in maintaining peace along the Blue Line, addressing violations, and averting further escalation, the resolution urges Lebanon to bolster its naval capabilities, aiming to diminish UNIFIL's Maritime Taskforce and transfer responsibilities to the Lebanese Armed Forces (UN, 2023). This resolution condemns Blue Line violations, urging compliance with international law and cooperation with the UN (UN, 2023). The Council reaffirms UNIFIL's independence, encourages progress towards a permanent ceasefire, and acknowledges various countries' perspectives during discussions (UN, 2023). Lebanon calls for attention to its concerns, regretting the resolution's partial address and advocating a focus on stability and security under Chapter VI (UN, 2023). While not strictly a legal tool, mediation involves a neutral third party actively participating in negotiations between conflicting parties (Yeini, 2020). This mediator can suggest solutions and comment on the positions of the parties, which can lead to agreements, regulations, or laws that become legally binding (Yeini, 2020). Mediators can be entities like states, international organizations, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), or private individuals (Yeini, 2020). While the UNSC can mediate conflicts upon request, often, third-party states voluntarily take on this role, mainly when dealing with unequal forces (Yeini, 2020). Third-party mediation can create a sense of equality, leading to a fairer resolution than direct negotiations between significantly unequal parties (Yeini, 2020). The recently negotiated maritime boundary agreement between Israel and Lebanon is significant amid ongoing Middle East tensions (Ross, 2022). Facilitated by the United States, the agreement has lessened the risk of conflict between the two nations, which, despite being technically at war, now share a common interest in natural gas extraction, fostering regional stability (Ross, 2022). Without this agreement, the potential for conflict would have risen due to Hezbollah's threats and Israel's security concerns (Ross, 2022). The deal addresses conflicting claims over natural gas resources, particularly in the Qana field, establishing a framework for cooperation. While it does not promise immediate peace, it signifies a move toward normalization (Ross, 2022). Despite critics arguing that Israel made concessions, the Israeli security establishment backs the agreement, viewing it as vital for reducing the risk of war and potentially stabilizing Lebanon by generating much-needed revenue (Ross, 2022). Ross (2022) recognizes that this deal was only possible due to American mediation efforts, which helped further Israel, Lebanon, and American interests. References Humud, C. E.

In relation to Hamas's actions, Scheffer (2023) explores legal tools applicable to non-state actors, referencing provisions from the Geneva Conventions and the Rome Statute. The article emphasizes states' legal obligations when in conflict with such actors and examines Israel's rights in self-defense (Scheffer, 2023). Recommendations are provided for Israel to adhere to international humanitarian law, particularly in minimizing civilian casualties. Various legal tools derived from international humanitarian law and agreements are discussed, focusing on Hamas (Scheffer, 2023). These tools include Common Article 3 of the 1949 Geneva Conventions, Article 51 of the Geneva Conventions’ Protocol I, and Articles 7 and 8 of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC) (Scheffer, 2023). Additionally, the obligations under Article 75 of Protocol I of the Geneva Conventions and Article 51 of the United Nations Charter are highlighted (Scheffer, 2023). Scheffer (2023) outlines specific standards that should be met, including avoiding starvation as a weapon, minimizing civilian casualties, and allowing the return of displaced civilians.  Scheffer (2023) also addresses Israel's legal right to use force to rescue hostages, emphasizing the criteria such actions must meet under customary international law (Scheffer, 2023). Cox and Van Nostrand (2022) discuss restorative justice as a potential strategy to reduce the likelihood of conflict recurrence in post-conflict settings. The article emphasizes that decisions regarding post-conflict justice are constrained by the uncertainties and volatility of the post-conflict environment (Cox & Van Nostrand, 2022). Cox and Van Nostrand suggest that policymakers' decisions are likely influenced by a desire to maintain control amid instability, considering the legal institutions that may shape the nature and scope of post-conflict justice. It is important to acknowledge that international law extends beyond legal judgments, encompassing diverse functions in various conflict resolution forums. These roles involve facilitating communication between conflicting parties, substantiating arguments, offering a legal viewpoint on issues, and guaranteeing the execution of conflict resolutions (Onuma, 2017). Although international law can aid conflict resolution, its universal and unwavering characteristics may pose challenges (Onuma, 2017). Historical disagreements, such as the Israel-Palestine conflict, are deeply embedded in the past, which may question the appropriateness of resolving disputes through contemporary international law. Given the intricate and evolving nature of the Israel-Palestine conflict, especially the recent development regarding the restart of military operations, what strategy would be beneficial moving forward?  References  Cox, J.

Onuma (2017) recognizes that international law plays a vital role in promoting cooperation among states and preventing conflicts, especially war outbreaks. It operates through mechanisms like the International Court of Justice (ICJ) and diplomatic negotiations (Onuma, 2017). In the modern era, international law should extend its focus beyond traditional notions of the peaceful settlement of international disputes, addressing diverse areas, including conflicts involving non-state actors and human rights issues (Onuma, 2017). A more flexible and functional approach is essential to move away from old state-centric and judicial-centric thinking (Onuma, 2017). Onuma (2017) acknowledges that conflicts are inherent among people, including nations, due to differences in interests, values, and perceptions.  Yeini (2020) mentions positive peace concepts using warmth and stability spectrums. This classifies peace from cold to normal to warm (Yeini, 2020). India-Pakistan, lacking a formal Kashmir peace agreement, is in cold peace, like a continuous ceasefire, making it insecure (Yeini, 2020). The stability spectrum categorizes peace into stable or minimal war probability, conditional, relying on deterrence, and precarious, with temporary cessation with dissatisfaction (Yeini, 2020). The Kashmir conflict has been deemed unstable, with force remaining a means of change (Yeini, 2020). Yeini (2020) stresses interstate collaboration for stable peace. While formal peace agreements are challenging, they benefit by addressing the conflict's root causes. However, many conflicts, like India-Pakistan over Kashmir, often remain unsettled, resulting in inherently unstable peace (Yeini, 2020). Since 1972, India has generally avoided third-party involvement in the Kashmir issue, while Pakistan has sought to internationalize it, primarily through United Nations Security Council (UNSC) actions (Kronstadt, 2020). In 2019, India made significant legal changes in the Jammu and Kashmir region, ending its special status and dividing the state (Kronstadt, 2020). This move faced criticism for using force and questionable legal arguments (Kronstadt, 2020). The international community, including Pakistan, China, and the UN, viewed the region as disputed. The U.S. advocated for settling the Kashmir issue through negotiations, expressing concerns about human rights abuses and regional instability (Kronstadt, 2020). Kronstadt (2020) discusses the UN Secretary-General's call for maximum restraint and expression of concern about the human rights situation in the Indian-administered Kashmir. The Secretary-General emphasized that the UN's position in the region is governed by the Charter and applicable Security Council resolutions (Kronstadt, 2020). Kronstadt (2020) also mentions Beijing's support for Pakistan's request for UN involvement, leading to informal consultations among UN Security Council members. Out of the various diplomatic, economic, and legal tools we have discussed, which do you feel can be the most effective in resolving the India-Pakistan conflict? References  Kronstadt, K. A.

Hi [name],  I appreciate you sharing the podcast. You made an interesting point about reaching agreements based on economic rather than ideological or religious aspects. Thank you for your thoughtful post.

Question two had multiple errors. To begin, the student did not use \pi in their equation. Since, they are dealing with a circular object \pi is needed. Another mistake was the \frac{11}{2} I believe was supposed to be \frac{11}{12}, as the student was dealing with inches and forgot the 1 from the 12. Next, instead of changing feet to inches in the miles it can remain 5280ft and be multiplied by the 12 inches. The students work was close but gave a completely wrong answer. The work could have been set up as \frac{3300}{\min}\cdot\frac{11\cdot\pi\cdot inches}{rev}\cdot\frac{ft}{12}\cdot\frac{miles}{5280}\cdot\frac{60\min}{hr} we can then remove everything that does not have a number \frac{3300\cdot11\cdot\pi\cdot60}{12\cdot5280} solving the multiplication first \frac{6842388.800}{63360} which is 108mph or 107.992mph.

"Dec 7, 2023 11:46PM [name] Good Evening Class, I covered the East Palestine, Ohio Train Derailment in Module 1. This is where a Norfolk Southern train carrying hazardous materials and chemicals derailed because of an overheated wheel bearing that led to a controlled burn-off, contaminating the area.  When discussing risk communication, there are many moral implications that need to be taken into account. Anyone in a role where the stakeholders are depending on you to provide accurate and timely information needs to fully realize their responsibilities. Especially in a local government whose charge is to provide the resources to train and equip those who are responding to a crisis. An entity that does not look like they know what they are doing will quickly lose the faith of those around them and lose control of the narrative. As seen in other disasters, governments who do not control the narrative are quickly ignored and independent people publish messages that are not verified, which could lead to more harm than good. This is a difficult balance because you want to get information out quickly, however you want to ensure that it is accurate. Communication was poor across many agencies. Approximately 70 agencies responded this event and experienced a communication breakdown as their radios were not programmed to talk to one another (East Palestine train derailment: Evacuation order lifted as officials say air and water samples show it's safe 2023).  In the short term, many residents were exposed to a large toxic plume of vinyl chloride because the emergency management team thought they were making the best decision with the information they had. However, there was a large information gap between Norfolk Southern, Oxy Vinyls (the company that manufactures the chemical), and responders on the ground. Ethically, Norfolk Southern failed to share information to the crisis action team making decisions. And for what purpose? Why did they withhold this information? This led to the long-term effect of the community being concerned that the air, water, and soil in the surrounding area is contaminated. Many residents share that they have a strong distrust in the local government and the Environmental Protection Agency and their response to this crisis situation. As Norfolk Southern is paying the EPA for its clean-up efforts and making ‘charitable’ donations to the community, many in the community do not trust that and see it as an PR stunt to rebuild their reputation (Hirji 2023).  Ethically speaking, this can be seen as 'slimy' due to the image of trying to buy back the communities trust. In a future situation like this one, there needs to be more proactive measures put into place. Currently, there are many discussions happening at the federal level to standardize the safety features across the railroad industry, including more 'hot-box' sensors at consistent intervals across the tracks. To solve many of the problems encountered in this crisis, there needs to be training events held to exercise the command and control nodes to ensure information is being disseminated appropriately. For example, many of the first responders did not have access to the app that the rail company was using to push updates. The first responders were volunteers that did not have hazardous material training and did not know what they were dealing with because the plastic placards indicating hazardous material was present melted away from the fire. If it were known that the cars where carrying hazardous material sooner, evacuations and decisions could have been make quicker, potentially preventing an incident as bad.

It is interesting that so many public officials resigned over the course of this crisis. Like you have mentioned in this post and earlier presentations, the local government had given the public so many reasons to lose faith in them between their Covid-19, economic, and crisis responses. This reminds me of the 2021 Texas Winter Storm Uri situation when Texas Senator Ted Cruz left the state and went to Cancun. Supposedly, this was a planned trip prior to the weather event, yet many Texans were outraged their leadership had fled the state when many could not afford to do the same. I imagine that this is how the Lebanese felt when their leadership began resigning left and right, leaving them directionless. In many of these emergency situations, it seems that communication is always something that can be improved, but this is great example of an event that drastically needed improvement in this category. Great and informative post.  Respectfully, [name] from Module 8 Discussion: Ethics and Outcomes (AI Enhanced Assignment) 15 hours ago [name] Hello [name], This was such an interesting event to live through. I mentioned this in another post, but an ethical choice that was at the forefront of discussion and outrage was when our senator, Ted Cruz, left with his family to Cancun during this crisis. This was seen as bad leadership, leaving behind everyone who could not afford to or realistically leave Texas. Adding to your points of reform, Governor Abbott recently accepted the resignation of the chairman of the Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUC), Peter Lake, who has only been the Chairman since April of 2021, almost immediately following the winter storm (Governor Abbott announces departure of PUC chairman lake 2023). This makes me wonder how much work he was truly able to accomplish to produce a positive impact on these issues so that it does not happen again. Great post.

i	6797

both	70
some	419

one	958
big	75

what	1119
would	697
our	160
world	53
be	1119
like	600
today	31
without	51
the	6833
internet	n/a
that	3169
we	1060
have	1365
today	31
i	6797
know	1621
that	3169
life	43
still	130
went	435
on	1360
even	135
without	51
internet	n/a
access	5
but	1652
i	6797
feel	100
as	912
though	110
everything	74
moved	16
much	395
slower	3
in	3123
business	60
and	5453
life	43
without	51
it	3653
i	6797
think	1190
this	1582
may	157
be	1119
mainly	5
because	616
i'm	619
so	1188
accustomed	1
to	4434
having	119
easy	21
access	5
to	4434

i	6797

the	600.19

was	601.12
the	600.19
creation	688.16
of	620.42
the	600.19

those	629.1

one	592.65
big	534.5
question	597.44
i	631.28
have	592.88
is	588.85
what	611.74
would	638.94
our	617.29

today	566.09
i	631.28

on	560.06
even	594.27
without	643.85

i	631.28
feel	593.65

everything	844.81
moved	637.74

business	646
and	631.74
life	519.56
without	643.85
it	566.85
i	631.28
think	596
this	632.13
may	637.91
be	598.42
mainly	623.06
because	610.68
i'm	676.19

the	212

was	272
the	212

because	310
if	278
you	432

the	212

so	273
this	303

and	290
i	506
would	245
say	n/a
that	287
it's	n/a
a	260

what	389
would	245
our	358

today	n/a
without	330
the	212

that	287

still	397
went	369
on	290
even	411
without	330
internet	n/a
access	n/a
but	225
i	506
feel	502
as	238
though	n/a
everything	n/a
moved	428
much	380
slower	425
in	413
business	461
and	290
life	533
without	330
it	363
i	506
think	500
this	303
may	405

it	10.3

earlier	6.4

the	10.92
local	7.32

had	10.16
given	8.25
the	10.92

many	8.6

many	8.6

their	10.28

had	10.16

the	1501908

many	18331

many	18331

the	8388

it	8377

so	8350
many	6297
public	2107

resigned	125
over	8171
the	8388
course	6666
of	8375
this	8360

like	8341
you	8381

mentioned	1254

this	8360

earlier	1584
presentations	18
the	8388
local	1498

had	8224
given	3071
the	8388

many	6297
reasons	1263
to	8383

this	8360
reminds	813
me	8355
of	8375
the	8388
2021	n/a
texas	508

left	7001
the	8388
state	2669
and	8379
went	6677
to	8383

supposedly	235
this	8360
was	8345
a	8382
planned	1300
trip	2366
prior	336
to	8383
the	8388
weather	1031
event	969
yet	6403
many	6297
texans	15
were	8237
outraged	60
their	7190
leadership	197
had	8224
fled	184
the	8388
state	2669
when	8312
many	6297
could	8233
not	8349
afford	1650
to	8383
do	8348
the	8388
same	6746
i	8372

this	8360

how	8341
the	8388

leaving	3962
them	8162
directionless	3
in	8372
many	6297
of	8375
these	7850
emergency	1646
situations	317
it	8377
seems	4557
that	8368
communication	433
is	8370
always	7495
something	8231
that	8368
can	8353
be	8363
improved	221

this	8360

an	8285

i	8372
mentioned	1254
this	8360

an	8285

was	8345
at	8346
the	8388
forefront	19
of	8375
discussion	543
and	8379
outrage	144
was	8345
when	8312
our	8113

with	8351
his	8186

during	2524
this	8360
crisis	611
this	8360
was	8345
seen	6541
as	8239
bad	7214
leadership	197
leaving	3962
behind	4729
everyone	5106
who	8318
could	8233
not	8349

realistically	25

"As I read through and thought about this discussion post I realized how little thought I have put into home network and router security settings. I have always relied on the built in security settings of my router by the internet service provider, we also use the password and network name that is pre-established on the router. After reading several articles about how to protect a home router and network from unwanted outside users I have determined that I will implement several new protection measures. One of the first I have done is to change my Wi-Fi password and then regularly change it on about a 6-month basis. I also changed the default router name and password from the factory settings. I also made sure my Wi-Fi encryption and firewall were activated. Another suggestion made that I have implemented is creating a guest network for both friends and devices that are easily hackable. A suggestion that I have not implemented is a VPN to protect my IP, I think this will happen in the not-too-distant future though. The last thing I did was to disable remote access to my router. I know that my network will never be totally secure but the additional changes I have made will help protect my family and I's personal and private information." "[name], I found through this Discussion post that I also am lacking tremendously in my security practices. I have never used a VPN but after reading your post and reflecting on my security practices I to think I will reevaluate and implement some new security protocols." "[name], I think you make valid points and I completely agree that once something is put on a device connected to the Internet it is forever accessible. We are only protected as long as the server our date is stored on is not penetrated by a hacker."

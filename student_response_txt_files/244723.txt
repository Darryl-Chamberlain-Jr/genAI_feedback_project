Here is the next student submission: Page 1 of 2  What was the most surprising thing you learned in this module? The most surprising thing that I learned on this module was the effectiveness of AI. I really had not tried to use AI prior to this module and found it amazing. By saying AI, I am referring to ChatGPT, Google Bard, and those types of AI. I have used things like Siri before. It was eye opening how quickly and accurately AI was able to present me with information that I asked for. I think that is one of the most interesting things to think about with AI, is where is the data coming from. We learned that the big players of the country are the ones providing the services of AI currently sue to cost. To me, this is another opportunity for mass control of information. I’ll take my tinfoil hat off now.  Which example of communication technology covered in this module is the most significant to human history, in your opinion? Why? All of them from the internet to AI are important and rely on each other to come into existence. Each type of technology paves the way for progression development of the next advancement of technology. I do feel that the internet was the biggest “leap” that I have witnessed and happens to be covered in this module. It started relatively inaccessible and slow but has grown so quickly that now almost every human on the planet has access to it through the cell phone in their pocket. It is all connected through history. The internet, smart phones, not so smart phones, radio, telegraph...All the way backwards. It is all connected.  Do most digital communication technologies represent something entirely new, or are they reimagined versions of their analog predecessors? Why do you think so? I think I answered this previously but basically that the first types of communication technology have built a base for the next best thing to develop from. History shows us that, which is why I believe this.  What questions have been left unanswered for you in this module, and how might you continue your search for those answers? Some questions that I have can only be answered by time itself. What will AI bring to us that we haven’t experienced before? Those are things that I am curious about but the only way to learn those answers is to wait and see. Unless AI could start predicting future, which may become possible to an extend at some point.

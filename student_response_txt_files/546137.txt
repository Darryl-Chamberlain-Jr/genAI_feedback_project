	An electricity-reliant security for our nation can pose various challenges, such as excessive focus on energy consumption. This dilemma put more stress on government and agency officials and drives a higher need for more energy availability. Without being able to meet the energy needs with renewable energy, the government will have to continually rely on oil, coal and gas to produce the needed energy requirements. This continued usage only furthers the damage done to the climate and speeds up climate change. Author David Toke writes that “Tackling emissions from energy will therefore be crucial for climate mitigation. In addition, energy is often seen as a priority policy area for many countries, as it is an important driver of economic growth and prosperity” (Toke, 2013). Globally, nations need to emphasize a drive to lessen energy usage as well as increase the amount of renewable energy.  Challenges in homeland security can also arise due to over-reliance on energy and electricity, such as setting a large target on our nation’s back. With a major attack on our energy industry, not only would many federal systems be shut down, but various integral industries would suffer setbacks and system failures. This could ultimately cause widespread panic and create snowball effect as people migrate to different areas in the US to find the resources they need, causing major strain on the whole nation. On a more positive side, The amount of energy production that the US can muster has helped others in need, and author Geoffrey Pyatt states that recent attacks on Ukraine’s energy by Russia “has demonstrated how US national security, and the security of our friends and allies, depends on energy security, and how America’s energy abundance can contribute to our alliance relationships” (Pyatt, 2024).

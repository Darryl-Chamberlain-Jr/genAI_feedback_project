"Hey Class, Protecting your privacy through online services is an important aspect of life. It is an easy way for anyone to hack your information. A few ways that I protect my own privacy is completing regular software updates, having strong passwords and two factor authentication enabled, and overall being aware of the risks that can be encountered. By ensuring my devices have the most up to date software, it ensures my devices have the latest security patches installed. Strong passwords and two factor authentication is a great way to maximize your ability to increase your privacy. Changing passwords regularly is also a great thing to do. Regarding my wifi router, I don't necessarily do anything in that aspect mainly because I am not really sure or have ever thought about my privacy regarding that. But from a quick google search you can get a unique SSID and password, disable WPS, and utilizing guest networks. By implementing these few measures I am able to increase my privacy and minimize my chances of being hacked online and at home.

Interesting to hear you use a downloaded VPN app and stuff to protect yourself. Definitely a good idea these days." "I used to have Norton on my old computer but never got it on my one I have now. I probably should have something other than just whats in the firewall. I have experienced the same thing with government sites, Id agree that it's probably because they are more secure than other sites."

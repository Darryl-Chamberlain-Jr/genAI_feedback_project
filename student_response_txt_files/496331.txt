Okay, here is the final student submission: By far, the most surprising thing was my introduction to using AI. I always thought you had to pay for AI tools like ChatGPT so discovering that there was a free version of this module was quite a surprise. I was very impressed with how much information it could provide me with in mere seconds. Unlike a search engine like Google, it was like having a conversation with someone and I didn’t have to scroll through ads or click on links. It was a very convenient way to get information. The most interesting part is that the information was mostly accurate. Again, the drawback is that you cannot know the references where it got the information from so credibility is limited. I know it was accurate because I had researched the topic I had asked about. I believe that the introduction of computers was the most significant to human history. It allows people worldwide to instantly connect and share information. Through email, social media, and messaging platforms, individuals can communicate across vast distances at little to no cost. It facilitates collaboration, knowledge exchange, and cultural exchange on an unprecedented scale. Additionally, it enables access to a vast repository of information, empowering users to learn, educate, and innovate like never before. Overall, the internet revolutionizes how humans interact, learn, and communicate, making it a pivotal advancement in human history. I believe that most technology is an updated rendition of another one. Telephones evolved from telegraphs. Computers evolved using the transistors in televisions and older electronic calculator electronics. The internet wouldn’t have been invented had there been no computers. I do feel there are technologies out there that came about as their idea but it is difficult to say for certain if the involvement of other technology, even for inspiration was not used. I do not have clear questions to take from this module other than having to ask what future technologies will bring to the table for future technologies, Now that we see how far technology has come and its exponential growth through history, it makes sense to feel as if there is no, imitation, at least in terms of communication. Let’s invent holographic communication, please. All jokes aside, I believe that keeping up with technologies in the news and through peer- reviewed articles will be the best way to keep answering the question of what is to come.

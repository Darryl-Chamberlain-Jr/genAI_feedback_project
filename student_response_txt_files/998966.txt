"When it comes to protecting my devices while at home or in public, first thing I start with is what wifi connection I use. At home I have it set up to where I can use a VPN. Or most commonly I like to change up passwords every now and then. In public I never connect to any WIFI spots, unless I am 100% certain its a secured connection. To often I see stories about how people make fake WIFI connections and get peoples information. While using devices, I avoid any links that have no relation to what I am doing, and if the computer says its an unsecured link, I don't click it! But as far as software, my MacBook has the anti-virus software (Xprotect). It updates usually when the MacIOs does. Or at least I am certain thats how it works. But if anyone knows it better than me, please share! All together, i make sure I am using a WIFI connection I trust, don't click on things that seem fishy, and keep my Mac updated when updates come out for the anti-virus software." "great post! I agree that using unique passwords, two factor authentication are a good start to protecting your information! But I see you pointed out having a primary network and a secondary for guests. I am going to have to look into that myself!" "great post and insight on how you protect yourself while online! Strong passwords and two factors are a great first step in my opinion. I do the same thing. Also another great thing is to not click on things you probably shouldn't be opening. I know if I don't recognize it, I don't open it!

"Good evening class, When it comes to accessing public Wi-Fi on my mobile devices, I rarely use public hotspots. I personally just use my mobile data or create a hotspot with my phone if I need to access my personal computer on the go. For protection of privacy on most applications and websites I go to that require personal information or verification, I turn cookies off and have an ad blocker on. For social media all my accounts are private and have bare minimum information about me unless we are connected. At home for my WI-FI I have a sweet app that tells me when and what devices are connected, I can also force remove those from the app if I choose. My home WI-FI router requires a password to connect to, so I donâ€™t really have to worry about random people trying to use it. Overall, I am aware of the devices connected to my home network and when I am utilizing public networks, keeping my personal stuff minimal and private on social media." "Good evening [name], Thank you for sharing your post, I could say the same when it comes to my internet protection. I mainly am just cautious of my updates and what networks I am connected to. I so far have no issues, so I would say it is working fine as of now!" "Good evening [name], Thanks for sharing your post with the class, you bring up a good point about utilizing a VPN. This actually reminds me that on deployments I have been on. When in other counties and relying on public WiFi to communicate with family and friends back home, I would always use a VPN. Whether it really made a difference or not, I am not sure but it was just an added level of security." "@[name] I think it would be trustworthy, however I personally do not use it when I am there only because I rarely go and if i do it's a quick in and out!"

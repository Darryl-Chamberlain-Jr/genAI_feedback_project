Resource-based conflicts, discussed in Paul G. Harris's Chapter 5, leads to destabilization as climate change intensifies competition for scarce resources (destabilization influence that results from resource-based conflict). Harris advocates that a shift to people-centered diplomacy is important, focusing on individual rights and responsibilities in climate politics, challenging the traditional blame on developed nations. Proposals like "contraction and convergence" demonstrate efforts to integrate individual concerns into global climate frameworks, highlighting the need to prioritize people over nation-states for just climate policies (Harris, 2013. Growing Role of the Natural Environment in Political/Economic Destabilization: The natural environment plays a pivotal role in contributing to political and economic destabilization within regions. During TED Talk by Misha Glenny, organized crime networks exploit environmental resources, such as illegal trade in oil, charcoal, and wildlife, to fund their operations (Glenny, 2009). In addition, the study on climate change in the Fertile Crescent (Kelley et al., 2015) shows how environmental factors, like severe droughts made worse by human-induced climate change, can contribute to political instability, migration, and economic collapse. Analysis of Political/Economic Destabilization and U.S. Security Concerns: Political or economic destabilization within a country or region can have direct implications for U.S. security. The TED Talk by Rodrigo Canales on drug cartels emphasizes the complex and dynamic nature of these criminal organizations (Canales, 2013). Destabilized regions become fertile grounds for illicit activities, including transnational crime, terrorism, and the trafficking of people, drugs and natural resources. These conditions create security threats that require U.S. intervention, either directly or through collaborative efforts, to prevent the growing violence, protect global stability, and safeguard economic interests (Bergenas & Knight, 2015). If you have watched the news in the past month, you will notice many criminals not only stealing from pricey stores but also resisting authority and hurting law enforcement trying to stop them. Canales Ted talk did not leave a happy fuzzy feeling, and this quote will live with me for a while. “We are actually accomplices to them. Either through our direct consumption, Or, through our acceptance’” - Canales, R. (2013, October). The question then becomes, how do we awaken people to the reality?  References:  Harris, Paul. G.

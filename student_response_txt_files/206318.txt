Here is the next student submission: I think one of the most interesting things that I read about was from the module 5 reading. The video “Everything is a Remix” was mind blowing to me as it discussed how most things in society are copies, or remixes, or something from an earlier time. In the sense of technology, everything on the internet was inspired by something else and collective ideas have led to the creation of different and new things. An example from the video was Dave Grohl copying songs from disco bands when he was the drummer in Nirvana. He would use songs from The Gap Band, Cameo, and Tony Thompson in many of the band's songs at the times. Another example was from Daft punk, that utilized Eddie Johns's 'More Spell on You’ to create ‘One More Time.’ Daft Punk’s song took three small parts of Johns’s song and sliced it, slowed it down, and repeated it to create their hit song. What seemed like an original piece of music was inspired by many performers from before their time. It was very shocking to me to see how much music is inspired by other pieces and brought together to create something new and unique. In my opinion, Chat GPT has the possibility to be the most significant technology to human history, if it eventually becomes what it is capable of being. As of now, Chat GPT continues to evolve in its ability to comprehend and address information given to the language model. As we have seen over the last year, it has exploded with possibilities to have it answer questions, analyze information, and compute different things. However, in its infancy, it still comes across problems. The reading, ChatGPT is a Blurry JPEG of the Web, states, “It’s also a way to understand the ‘hallucinations,’ or nonsensical answers to factual questions, to which large language models such as ChatGPT are all too prone.” This statement comes from when the text was discussing how ChatGPT repackages information from around the web to reply to inputs given by the user. The model struggles to answer specific questions and can miss out on details that the user is looking for in the response of the model. But as months have gone by, the model is learning at an exponential rate and only gets better by the date. I believe that this technology will eventually replace jobs and cut work time dramatically as we see these models become more sophisticated. I believe that most digital communication technologies can be seen as a combination of reimagined versions of their analog predecessors and entirely new developments. Many digital communication technologies build upon analog technologies, like how email is a digital version of traditional mail, and digital cameras evolved from film cameras. However, these technologies also introduce transformative changes, such as the speed of communication, ease of storage, and the ability to manipulate data in ways that were not possible with analog methods. We can also see how digital technologies often integrate multiple functions that analog technologies consist of into a single device, like how smartphones combine features of traditional phones, cameras, calculators, and more. In the aspect of digital technologies being something new, these have introduced new capabilities that were not feasible with analog counterparts. The internet enables instant global communication and information exchange, which was never possible with traditional postal services. While there is a continuum between analog and digital technologies, the capabilities, convergence, and new functionalities introduced by digital communication technologies set them apart from most analog predecessors. A question that has still been left unanswered is what we expect ChatGPT’s capability to be in the near and distant future. We witnessed in the last year the exponential growth of this AI software from its infancy to what it has become in today's society. I wonder what it will be capable of in a year from today and how it will even further impact businesses, jobs, and everyday life.

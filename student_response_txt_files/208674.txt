Here is the next student submission: What was the most surprising thing you learned in this module? The most interesting thing was to learn about how the internet became what it is today. I had always wondered how the internet was created and I had just never done any research on it. The internet readings in this module were a great insight into how all of the different "internets" of the 70s and 80s really shaped how the internet is today. Which example of communication technology covered in this module is the most significant to human history, in your opinion? Why? Although the remixes and networked communication technologies are very important, the most significant was the creation of the Internet because if you think about it, those technologies probably wouldn't be possible today if it wasn't for the Internet. The Internet has made many things possible that were probably never thought to be possible. The ability to have nearly unlimited amounts of information that we can find almost instantly with our computers or devices is a feat of its own. Do most digital communication technologies represent something entirely new, or are they more or less reimagined versions of their analog predecessors? Why do you think so? This is a very good question and I would say that it's a little bit of both. Some newer digital communication technologies are entirely new technologies that have never been used before, although they are using the same means such as radio, microwave, radiation, electromagnetic, etc. Many technologies that we use today are just newer and updated versions of analog predecessors like TVs, smartphones, and MP3/iPods. What questions have been left unanswered for you in this module, and how might you continue your search for those answers? One big question I have is what would our world be like today without the Internet that we have today? I know that life still went on even without Internet access, but I feel as though everything moved much slower in business and life without it. I think this may be mainly because I'm so accustomed to having easy access to the Internet since I was little and I am just so used to being able to use it for nearly anything I need.

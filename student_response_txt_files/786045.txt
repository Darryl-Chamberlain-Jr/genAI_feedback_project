Here is the next student submission: Throughout this module, I learned a great deal about how technology and the web have influenced how we as a society communicate. I would say the most surprising thing for me was learning about web 1.0 and 2.0. Up to this point, I’ve never heard of these two types of internet, and I’ve always just generalized what we call the internet. Now I understand that web 1.0 is a static website, one in which Information flows one direction—from the website creators to the users. It is also very limited in that things like comment sections or forums were rare, and user experience was mainly about consuming content. On the flip side, Web 2.0 is much more dynamic because websites change based on user input. Everyday people can become content creators, not just consumers. I also believe that this was the most significant part of this module pertaining to how humans communicate and our history. We used to be extremely passive with web 1.0 because it didn’t allow for any creativity or input of our own. Suddenly, a major revolution happened with web 2.0 allowed for regular people to easily publish and share their thoughts, photos, or videos online. This made way for huge companies like Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat to reach a market size of $219.06 billion in 2023 that will climb to nearly $251.45 billion in 2024 (The Business research Company, n.d.). This presents a giant market that will only grow with time; thus, a lot of this success can be contributed to Web 2.0. Moreover, I believe that a lot of this success is innovative; what we are seeing now with AI is completely revolutionary. I don’t see a direct correlation between the technology we now have and our ancestors' forms of technology. However, basic forms like the need to communicate and finding new ways to do so can draw ties back to ancient communication. I don’t have many questions left unanswered besides how our society will adapt to these revolutionary changes. Will it be a great invention, or the downfall of humanity? I guess only time can tell.

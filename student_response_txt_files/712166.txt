It is near impossible to imagine living without electricity. For some, in extreme circumstances, it is a nightmarish reality. After a devastating storm, power can be knocked out for several days or even more than a week. In these situations, we are reminded of the overwhelming reliance on our electrical grid we are, and these are just localized incidents that pale in comparison to a nationwide emergency. In a way, this over reliance on our energy grid can mean a major vulnerability that our enemies can exploit, causing a major Homeland Security problem. In the recent years there have been numerous attacks on our grid that have left us vulnerable. For example, there were 362 attack on our grid between the years 2011 and 2014 (CNA, 2015). More recently, the Colonial Pipeline that supplies gas for our energy grid was cyber attacked leaving many on the east coast in trouble (CISA, 2023). These are just a couple examples of how vulnerable our energy grid can be, and it signals to others how vulnerable we can be. However, our government is also seeing these incidents and are using them to influence the future of our energy grid policies. One huge issue that we currently have is our aging infrastructure (Toke, 2013). With how much the country is growing and how much more energy we are needing, the energy grid needs to be updated. This can mean billions of dollars and lots of different update ideas. From nuclear, to solar and wind, there are developing policies to transition to cleaner and more renewable energy solutions, so we are not as reliant on foreign sources of energy. In the most recent infrastructure bill signed in 2021, $65 billion was committed to facilitating this update to our grid and cleaner sources of energy (US GOV, 2021). With these new changes and hopefully more policies to come, our over-dependence on an aging vulnerable grid can be reduced or managed to a safer level.

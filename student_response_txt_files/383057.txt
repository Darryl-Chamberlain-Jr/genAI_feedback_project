"I don't have any significant security features with my router. However, I use a lengthy password with multiple special characters to keep my password strength high and use different passwords for myvarious accounts. I also ensure that I never store my bank information, personal information, and other login information in add-ons such as Google Password Manager. I only use my laptop for school, work, and the occasional Steam game purchase/download; out of those three, the only major threat I see is downloading games off Steam. I've researched a few games where developers would sneak files into their video game downloads that allow them to access features such as administrative privileges. However, when caught, the developers will pull the "It's to check the integrity of the players to scan for hacking software" card, to which I say, "Such files should be made clear with a prompt, informing the audience these files exist in the download before hitting the download button." Outside of my home, some of the security practices I take include not connecting to public wifi, putting my trust in an RFID wallet, and not storing card information or bank information on my phone. For traveling, I've never paid for the WIFI airplanes offer, and I usually download movies and shows at home before the flight so I can place my phone in airplane mode for the ride." "The good old barracks' WIFI is not only slow but needs to be more secure. I took a C-School in Great Lakes called Tactoe, a Cisco Unix Networking class, to which the instructors didn't outright say it but taught us the skill to "create" a WIFI backdoor.I deleted my Go-WIFI account that day and luckily transferred within the next two weeks to another C-School Command. On that note, VPNs are secure; however, they do have some privacy cons that are worth taking a look at. I agree that although all the GPS and voice settings are turned offfor my social media apps, they are still listening! Great post; however, there are a few grammar mistakes in your opener and the second sentence; also, the format could be a lot better. You should be able to edit your post before Friday, so save yourself on some point hits. Enjoy your week!" "I agree, not a fan of accessing public networks, especially in airports. Personally I just download my movies and shows prior to flying, along with a game that doesn't require internet access (whenever I can find one). VPNs are great, however I would look into some of the privacy cons that come with them. I would argue that the pro's to outweigh the cons though. Have a great week!

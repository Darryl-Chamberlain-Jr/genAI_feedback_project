"The internet is something we use all the time all over the world. I'm using it now in Doha, Qatar to do homework from the other side of the world. I use it every night to text my parents, girlfriend, and friends all in different places at different times. The internet has increased the ease of communicating and banking from anywhere in the world but also leaves you vulnerable to cyber attacks. There are many different ways people can access and steal your information. Many times older people are targeted by these people as they don't understand how to protect themselves. The ways people can protect themselves is by not giving away information online, accessing sketchy links, using virtual proxy networks, and not using local networks outside of their home network. I don't take too many precautions when protecting myself other than not giving people my information and ignoring those weird texts and emails you get such as the amazon has a package at the warehouse for you one. Taking those steps have kept my information safe so far but I could download a vpn to increase my security." "Hello [name], I share in your opinion of not sharing too much on the internet as a good approach to protect yourself. I should probably invest in a VPN to use when I do but not using the internet very much is definitely the best approach at keeping your information safe. I differ from you though in the case that a lot of my passwords are the same with only small changes, making that part of my security pretty weak." "Hello [name], I just updated my router as it was almost 5 years old and the new one came with increased security and options for me. I also only use my computer anti-virus software that's almost 7 years old as well. I downloaded a free McAfee security scanner to detect viruses. I could probably do well with some upgraded security software and sweepers to help secure and optimize my computer."

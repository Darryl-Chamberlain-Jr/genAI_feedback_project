The India-Pakistan conflict garners concern on an international level, capturing the need for strong legal reform implementation. Balance is required between domestic legal reform and international legal reform. Domestic legal systems, as it relates to post-conflict justice, contributes to peace and stability within communities which have experienced war or severe conflict ( Cox, & Van Nostrand, 2022). Concerning the Kashmir region, India and Pakistan continue to assert dominance over the topic of legal reform within the area. In particular, India has expressed with fortitude that it interprets the region of Jammu and Kashmir as an extension of India. Pakistan has offered to take steps towards the further development of peace talks, but only if India makes the first initiative towards such action (Gunawan et. al., 2021). The United Nations (UN) has been involved, with a large portion of intervention serving as a direct response to repeated human rights violations within the area. In the year 2016, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights attempted to access the Jammu and Kasmir region so that legal and diplomatic presence could be established, allowing the local population to feel represented. India and Pakistan turned down this motive and request (Gunawan et. al., 2021). Inspired by UN Resolution 1514, 1948 and Article 1, 2 and 55 of the UN Charter, the right to every state in terms of an established self-determination holds true in modern day society. It represents the basis of human rights and is supported by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) as jus cogens, which requires formal adherence (Gunawan et. al., 2021). These serve as examples of legal tools, as they represent international intent to support legal reform within the Kashmir region. The international goal to support Kashmir through a transition of self-determination discovery, as a region, society and area of land is ongoing (Gunawan et. al., 2021). Evaluate how actors utilized these legal tools and how specifically they used these tools and any related mechanisms with the aim of resolving your conflict. An example of how the legal tools have been implemented largely includes Kashmir’s attempts to reign as a sovereign state, with the support of the ICJ. This is initiated through stabilizing Kashmir across social, economic, and infrastructural elements (Gunawan et. al., 2021). Additionally, Legal tools which apply to the India-Pakistan conflict revolve around the ICJ helping Kashmir to gain status of self-determination, with support from UN Resolution 1514, 1948 and Article 1, 2 and 55 of the UN Charter, for example. The issue that exists in modern times involves India and Pakistan’s reluctance to support the UN and ICJ with the implementation of legal reform within Kashmir. Where Pakistan has previously gave sign of subtle willingness to conform, they assert the stance that India must comply first. This continues to place Kashmir in an uncomfortable position, one where human rights violations continue to occur. The recommendation presented is for Pakistan and India to come to an agreement to fully support Kashmir’s right to gain self-determination, as supported by the UN Resolution 1514 and 1948. In the meantime, the Security Council holds the right to hold India and Pakistan accountable and apply pressure, through partnership with the ICJ. References Cox, J. M., & Van Nostrand, R. D. (2022).

Additionally, within the research that you share, mediation is further addressed by exploring the role that it played throughout Europe during the nineteenth century. A close look at the minimal impact of war during this period, despite heavy presence of great powers during this time, reveals that leaders, philosophers, and professionals who appeared in the legal realm held contrasting impressions on how international peace and reform should be implemented. Despite this finding, one area that officials could agree on involved the belief that no matter the manner behind which it should be implemented, international peace should remain a priority, as tranquility is essential for promoting success in other areas of socio economics (Yeini, 2020). Thank you for sharing your research on this topic, as it relates to the importance of mediation in support of legal tools used during conflict.   Reference Yeini, S. A. (2020).

Specifically, I feel that prisoner exchanges offer benefits in the areas of enhanced trust and communication with other states on a global scale. Additionally, the legal construct that lies beneath the inner workings of prisoner exchanges is complex, requiring patience and cohesion. A recent prisoner exchange includes the release of seven American prisoners from a prison in Iran in September of this year. Peace talks and negotiations contributed to the success of this prisoner exchange (Chambers et al., 2023). One area where legal implications reign heavily on the topic of prisoner exchanges involves the potential consequences that are suffered on the back end, after the prison exchange has been successfully accomplished. For example, in the aftermath of this particular prisoner exchange, the Biden administration was publicly criticized for having conducted a prisoner exchange with Iran, which is publicly known to sponsor terrorism (Chambers et al., 2023). This provides a modern-day example of how legal tools are a crucial component towards conflict, or tensions that arise from activities relating to prisoner exchanges. Thank you for your research provided in support of this topic.    Reference Chambers, F., Collins, M., Hjelmgaard, K., Meyer, J. (2023).

Here is the next student sample: The most surprising thing I learned in this module was how Chat GPT provides theories to the person instead of telling them that they don't have an answer. I am surprised because Chat GPT is a fact based generator that takes the information from websites. I just din't expect AI to give me opinions of what other people think the meaning of an artifact is. I also believe that the use of AI is the most significant to human history. AI increases efficiency but also allows humans to focus on more complex, creative, and strategic aspects of their work. The adoption of AI technologies has led to significant economic changes. Industries that leverage AI experience increased productivity, cost savings, and new business opportunities, contributing to economic growth. I believe that technologies are more of less reimagined versions of their analog predecessors. This is because before social media many people actively engaged with each other and share their experiences. With digital communication platforms often emphasize interactivity and user participation. Social media, forums, and collaborative online spaces allow users to engage, share, and contribute to conversations and content creation. Although, there are some new aspects like digital data. Digital communication involves the representation of information in discrete, binary code, allowing for precise and reliable storage, transmission, and processing of data. This is a retreat from the continuous signals of analog communication. An unanswered question I have is how Chat GPT is allowed to give people opinions and theories from websites? Is it because AI acts as a human and thats how a person would respond if they didn't have a factual answer?

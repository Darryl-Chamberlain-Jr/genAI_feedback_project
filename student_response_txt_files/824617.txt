"Safeguarding you’re at home network or personal devices is crucial, from the constant worry of cyber-attacks to hoping a device doesn’t inherit a virus of some sort. Knowing that a virus can not only attack PC’s but phones and tablets as well. Every device regardless of the type needs a wired connection to the internet or Wi-Fi, which is most common now. There are so many ways to safeguard a device or internet connection. While some may believe just a complex password can secure your personal data from any sort of cyber-attack, that is just one of the ways to safeguard your personal devices and internet connection. Personally, with my own experiences from annual work training to research online I have a routine of safeguarding my own personal data. Work has taught through training how to do 90-day password resets, avoid suspicious emails, along with proper transportation or sensitive material. For my personal use at home and work data security one of the biggest things I do is invest in a secure password vault like NordPass because of the numerous password changes made with multiple applications. Another trend I have personally inherited is not having the same password across multiple applications hence needing the password vault. The vault has multiple ways of logging in from biometrics to two-factor authentication or a simple pin. Also, the application backs up your information and you can login via desktop to access it at any time. Moreover, just relying on an application for your important passwords, protection of my home network and personal PC is critical just as much as my other devices and passwords. For my PC I purchased a core-level antivirus like McAfee to have a firewall protecting my network and personal information. Having McAfee on my PC I have gotten used to running monthly total PC virus scans as well as scheduled weekly scans that don’t take up too much time. More than just using McAfee keeping my PC up to date with operating system updates and security updates is needed. Having a Samsung PC, they have a user-friendly application that helps with the notifications and updates on this. While their multiple ways of safeguarding your information and network these are just some of what I personally use. Luckily, I have never ran into any issues with online security issues but am aware of them and the continual growth of them as well. I will continue to stay with these routines and hope to never encounter any negative online cyber issues. Reference: How to secure your home Wi-Fi network. (2024, April 23).

The sensitive and important information we all have on our PC's and phones if leaked can allow access to a multitude of platforms or even banking information if not worse. Although a good anti-virus can get pricey it is well worth it. I personally use McAfee as well and have never had any issues. Very recently I started using a VPN for enhanced security so we will see how it goes." "Although we are taught to stay away from these illegitimate websites, the sites are looking more and more legitimate. Also with how things are online shopping is a normal trend for people. When something looks interesting and of interest to buy people jump quick to just add there payment information and expect it to be safe. When truth is we just don't know. Using safeguards for everything is more then just important on a day-to-day basis."

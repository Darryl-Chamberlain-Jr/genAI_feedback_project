"Hello class, I want to preface this by saying that I don't worry about my privacy online nearly as much as I should; as in, I will take basic precautions such as never posting my name or specific location unless absolutely necessary, but I don't normally use a VPN or other extensive security measures to maintain my privacy. TO be completely honest, I think that companies like Google and Microsoft can track you down no matter what if they wanted, and precautions are more directed towards other internet users. Obviously, one of the best ways to protect your privacy against targeted attacks is to change up your passwords for different websites. It can be a bit tough to track all your passwords, but using the proper tools can be beneficial. Additionally, antivirus services like Microsoft Defender help prevent viruses from being downloaded on my computer, but I would never download something from a website that I'm not familiar with. Also, I try not to click on links from other websites unless I know exactly where it leads. On our Wi-Fi router, we use the WPA2 (Wi-Fi Protected Access 2) setting to prevent hackers and other unsolicited attacks from gaining entry into our network. It's the next generation of WPA, and it supposedly uses some of the best encryption algorithms today in order to protect the network. " "I'm also fairly guilty of not staying too wary of my privacy when it comes to security. However, I try not to connect to public Wi-fi pretty much ever, as I can use a personal hotspot for most things. However, if I do connect to public Wi-fi, I think it's safer to practice standard safety precautions like not revealing personal information or logging into sensitive websites. A VPN would also definitely help, as it increases your own personal security, and that's something that I need to work on as well." "I think that using a VPN, even at home, can be incredibly helpful to keeping your information safe. I also like how you change your passwords up fairly often; it's something that I need to start doing as well, as I only really change it when I'm prompted to do so. Anti-virus software is also helpful, but I would be wary of using a default anti-virus; it's also another thing that I need to look into, but I think it might be worth purchasing a high-quality anti-virus."

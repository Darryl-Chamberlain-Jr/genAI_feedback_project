"Dec 6, 2023 12:07PM [name] Hi [name], Thank you for once again leading the class in this discussion. I am eager to see how the AI bot grades this discussion post. That is very interesting to me. I am happy you spoke about this topic as it is very disturbing to have happen, however your analysis of this topic has been super. Great job on your post.  Sincerely, [name] from Module 8 Discussion: Ethics and Outcomes (AI Enhanced Assignment) Dec 6, 2023 12:54PM [name] Hello class, Just as a reminder I did my crisis on Covid - 19.  Discuss the moral implications of risk communication and identify situations in which ethical/legal responsibilities were broken. When a crisis presents itself it is devastating to all that are involved. Ethics are very important especially when in the midst of a crisis. During moments of crisis corporations and businesses are designed to protect themselves, and have special people in place to do so. This is where ethics can become challenging to uphold, especially if the corporation is at fault. It is tempting for them to leave out pertinent information that will incriminate them with the public and potentially cost them millions or billions of dollars like the BP oil spill crisis that ended up costing the company astronomical amounts of money.  The recent pandemic illustrated how unprepared the world was for something of this magnitude. The proper channels of communication were disrupted and vague and it was clear that no one fully understood what this virus was doing or how the world would be affected until it was too late. Individuals were left to fend for themselves and make crucial ethical decisions based on their symptoms and health. The healthcare system was shaken to its core and the instability it experienced with lack of personnel and resources were shocking. According to an article I researched, "So regardless of your position or industry, giving some serious thought to what ethical communication looks like to you and your organization before, during and after crises is crucial. One of the ways we can avoid missteps is to think through and visualize our ideal reactions. Creating a written crisis communication plan for a variety of possible crises and then simulating crises to test and reflect on your crisis responses are key tools for avoiding ethical transgressions when the real deal hits" (Ingram & Ingram, 2018).  Consider what happened in the situation, the short and long-term effects Covid - 19 challenged the world on multiple levels. Physicians were forced to make difficult decisions triaging patients and giving care to the ones that looked hopeful and able to be healed knowing if they did not treat everyone with this respect, many will die and have died as a result of not having the proper equipment like ventilators. Many people were left to fight the virus on their own or die as a result. It was a horrific time for the world to endure, and we are still not fully recovered from this virus and the devastation and loss it has caused. According to one article in particular, "The ethical implications of scarce resources are very drastic in this COVID-19 pandemic. The great demand for critical care services in several areas of the world, such as the northern region of Italy and New York, was exceeding the supply. Intensive care doctors were facing challenging decisions about who should receive a ventilator or not, knowing the fact that those who are not admitted to the intensive care units will very likely die. Physicians have to consider the prioritization of patients who are most likely to survive over those with remote chances. This practice has stimulated an immense debate about the right of everyone to get access to the health care" (Mannelli, C., 2020).   How these effects might be mitigated in a future situation (i.e., what could have been done better).  There are many who say that we (the public) were unaware of what was actually occurring with the virus. I know that the first cases were seen in December of 2019, and there were no mandates or real dangers of the virus until it was broadcasted across the world in March of 2020. That is three months later that the population could have used to prepare for the pandemic had we have been given the accurate information in a more timely manner.

[name] from Module 8 Discussion: Ethics and Outcomes (AI Enhanced Assignment) Dec 7, 2023 3:53PM [name] Hi [name], I did my discussion on the pandemic as well. It was so life changing and there is a lot of information covering this topic. I love your analogy on the "infodemic" is amazing. There were so much misinformation running rampant it was hard to keep track on what was truth or "fake news". People were believing others based on likeness and not facts. It was and still continues to be a crazy time. Thank you for this. Great job! Sincerely, [name]"

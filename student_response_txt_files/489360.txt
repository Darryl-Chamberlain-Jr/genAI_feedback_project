"Good morning class, security is a big thing when it comes down to internet and devices being connected. There's plenty of things to do to protect them that i probably have no clue about. I've never been worried about making sure my devices are private as its already a requirement for most of requirements. My router is private but one thing i do to make sure not to many things are connected is disconnecting old and not in use devices to keep my router with limited access as much as possible. I've realized in the past having too many appliances make everything run slow like gaming which takes up a lot of data. Other ways to help keep yourself more private is not connecting your devices to computers and giving them access to all your photos or even syncing things such as contacts and more to other devices that may ask, same for games or even other apps that may ask for your location and need certain requirements even when you're not using it to run. I'm pretty sure there are more ways to protect your privacy so if you're wondering on what else you may not know look here:https://www.techtimes.com/articles/303859/20240422/top-digital-privacy-tools-of-2024-how-to-safeguard-your-online-presence.htm" "I definitely use vpn but I only discovered the use of Vpn for the wrong reasons lol. Back when you could get on school Wi-Fi but to be able to use the internet and get on certain apps you had to get a vpn but I never knew how great it was or the full purpose of it until a year or so later when it became more convenient." "@[name] I feel you and sometimes public wifi is just convenient do certain things real quick. VPN's are great to use but how do you add or utilize on your computer? I travel outside the country due to my job and I was unable to go to certain sites or even use hulu, max and other apps due to the restrictions in that country."

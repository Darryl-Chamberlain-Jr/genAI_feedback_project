An electricity-reliant national security system poses several challenges for energy policy due to its critical role in ensuring the functioning of essential infrastructure, defense systems, and communication networks. One primary challenge is the vulnerability of centralized electricity grids to physical and cyber-attacks, natural disasters, and other disruptions. These vulnerabilities can have far-reaching consequences, leading to widespread power outages that can cripple critical services, disrupt supply chains, and undermine national security.  Furthermore, the reliance on electricity exacerbates energy supply risks and dependence on finite resources, such as fossil fuels, which are subject to geopolitical tensions and price volatility. This dependence constrains energy policy options, limiting flexibility in responding to evolving security threats and transitioning to more resilient and sustainable energy sources.  Energy over-reliance can result in homeland security challenges in the United States and for our allies by magnifying the impact of disruptions to energy supply chains and critical infrastructure. For example, disruptions to electricity grids can compromise the operation of defense systems, emergency response capabilities, and communication networks, hindering the ability to respond effectively to security threats and emergencies.  Additionally, energy over-reliance can heighten vulnerability to cyber-attacks targeting critical infrastructure, such as power plants, transmission lines, and control systems. Cyber-attacks on electricity grids can disrupt essential services, disrupt economic activity, and create opportunities for malicious actors to exploit security vulnerabilities for strategic or financial gain. Energy over-reliance can have geopolitical implications, as countries with limited energy resources may become dependent on imports from less stable or hostile regions. This dependence can create vulnerabilities to supply disruptions, price fluctuations, and political manipulation, posing security risks for both importing countries and their allies.  Addressing these challenges requires a multifaceted approach that prioritizes diversification of energy sources, investment in resilient infrastructure, enhancement of cybersecurity capabilities, and promotion of energy efficiency and conservation measures. By reducing dependence on centralized electricity grids and fossil fuels, promoting renewable energy deployment, and fostering international cooperation on energy security, policymakers can mitigate the homeland security risks associated with energy over-reliance and enhance national and global resilience to emerging threats.

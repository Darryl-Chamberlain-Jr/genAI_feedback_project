"Hello everyone, When traveling abroad I like to keep my personal electronics safe by not using any public wi-fi networks or guest accounts. Hackers have been know to be able to access those wi-fi networks/ create them to capture your personal data and information. To prevent this from happening I solely connect to my own personal hotspot through my phone or purchase a internet puck to travel with me. Another important feature I use is a VPN for my personal laptop. This protects me from further from any hackers that might try to take my personal information. This is extra critical for when using my Army government computer. At home I use a normal spectrum router and modem, I do not have any extra implementation of protective equipment and gear. I avoid suspicious emails and web traffic from sites and people I do not know and try to only visit and click on links that I know for sure are safe and legitimate." "I am with you, in the fact that I am not the most well read or knowledgable on my computer network security. I simply just try to not log onto sites that are not well known or seem fishy. I to use a VPN when I am using networks out and about." Great work on your discussion post, I really like how you utilize a separate guest network that will keep your primary network and information safe. I will definitely be doing that in future. I think your approach to network security is really comprehensive and safe. Great work!

"Internet privacy is a key component to a safe environment whilst online. You don't want anyone seeing your private activities or engage within them because that's only for you. There is a lot that comes with privacy, router safety can be compromised, a hacker or attacker may dox you, steal your identity, find your location, etc. Nobody wants someone to release private information because it can cause some seriously harmful events if the wrong person gets such details. There are a variety of precautions you can take to prevent information getting out however one sticks out as a basic yet strong security measure. This measure being a VPN (virtual private network) and this private network reroutes your IP address masking your true location and encrypting your browsing traffic. This is especially helpful when connected to public WIFI at any location. VPN's can be free or paid for, with the paid VPN's offering better security and easier private policies, but a free VPN is better than no protection at all and is a definite tool to ensure your internet safety while doing anything. https://joindeleteme.com/blog/what-is-internet-privacy-guide/ " "Strong passwords are the most basic yet useful tool you can do especially when you use more numbers and or special characters such as %^!. I agree with you strongly that updating a good anti virus is really useful and there are so many options to choose from! Norton is a great one and I personally use that one and I've had no viruses and no issues." "Common sense is a very easy concept and that is something a lot of people lack in. Restraint for clicking links is a very useful skill because attackers will do anything to bait their target. I applaud you for suing smart thinking to maneuver around bad choices thank you for your input!"

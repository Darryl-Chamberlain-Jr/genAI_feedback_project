"Greetings class! I am sure you all noticed that my post was a tad late but I hope you enjoy it all the same and I look forward to some criticism. Flying is something that I only did a few times growing up but it wasn't until the Navy that I became a frequent flyer. The information provided to us was very informative and it really got me thinking about things I never would have thought of. My first and only layer of defense for my electronic devices is as simple as a normal 4 digit passkey. However, the next time I travel on an airplane I will take a much different approach to include a VPN to try and prevent anyone from acquiring my personal information while we are connected to the same wifi. I think that this is a cool thing that airlines are doing to help adjust to the technology dependency and the ability to let this generation entertain themselves." "I really enjoyed your discussion post, it was very different and interesting. Your simplistic defense when it comes to not using public wifi is something that I will do from time to time and it definitely works. However, it can be a drag if there is a poor connection to the hotspot. Well done!" "Your post was very relatable to me. Not only do I too, take basic precautions while connecting to public wifi but I also agree with your scary thought that companies like google have the power to do anything they want if they really wanted to. Good job explaining your thoughts and organizing your post!"

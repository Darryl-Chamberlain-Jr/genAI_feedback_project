"Right now, as I sit writing this in my living room, I have 7 devices hooked up to the internet. Most homes now adays have just as many or more connected to the internet. Privacy and Security are always a concern, leaving a trail of personal data behind. Growing up when the internet became big, I did make mistakes early on that I learned from. Ways I combat this is using strong unique passwords, stopped sharing personal information on social media, and use a VPN when possible. I never log into any other wifi but my own. My router at home has an incredibly long and crazy password that I change every few months. The wifi is encrypted WPA2. I have set up a guest wifi for visitors. Overall, I try and do my best to keep my data safe. Every day it gets harder to keep it from the wrong hands." "You are doing a great job at keeping your information safe from the seedy underworld. It is hard to keep up with all the extra measures needed to keep our information safe these days. I am always slow to update firmware which puts me at risk." "You are doing a great job at keeping your information safe from the seedy underworld. It is definitely a nutty world with some pros and cons to it. I can't keep up with how fast the technology changes. Congrats on the new Baby. Enjoy it while you can."

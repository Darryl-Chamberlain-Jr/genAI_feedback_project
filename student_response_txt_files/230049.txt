Defining Food Security One problem that has come up consistently throughout the international community is the idea of starvation and what they can do in order to solve world hunger. Food security can be best defined as the protection against starvation, malnutrition from poor diets, food prices, and access to food (UNICEF, 2021). While this definition lays out the components of food security issue it encompasses all citizens from children to the elderly within a nation. World hunger has been a consistent issue throughout history and the international community strives to create food security amongst all nations. Food is a critical part of human life and if it is not met people can contract diseases and die without it. Challenges of Food Security Food insecurity is a difficult human security issue as it can result from situations out of a nations’ control such as droughts or other natural disasters. However, there are several factors that contribute to food insecurity other than simply agriculture destroyed from unforeseen natural disasters. One challenge of food security is derived from the prices of food; now the rise in prices can come from an array of factors such as war, poor economic state, and the political state of a nation (Kolodziejczak & Pawlak, 2020). This is one instance where it is not necessarily due to not enough agriculture within a nation but that the prices of food have gone up and for those in poverty has relinquished their ability to buy food. Another challenge of food security is malnutrition, this is an issue seen in the more developed nations such as Australia as citizens may be receiving the correct amount of calories however, they are lacking nutrients due to diet trends and processed foods (Dixon & Richards, 2016). While this issue may appear to be less dire than starvation due to food prices in lesser developed nations it is still a concern as without proper nutrition the body is more susceptible to catching diseases and unable to perform to its full potential. These are just two examples of food security challenges that affect both developed nations and underdeveloped nations. Factors Driving Food Security and Insecurity There are several examples around the world that help others understand why there are food insecurities and what steps have been taken in order to create food security within nations struggling with this crisis. The first case study comes from the food security issue in Nepal and their agricultural ecological problem. Nepal was struggling with food security due to the ecological system causing problems within its agricultural system as well as the youth in the nation moving from occupations relating to agriculture which left the older population overworked (Chaudhary, et al., 2016). With not enough citizens to work the fields crops were not being harvested and thus food was wasted as well as having agricultural issues due to the ecology of the nation. The way that this issue began to solve itself was when Nepal transitioned to a democracy which although a political change was able to help shift the agricultural and economic situation of the nation (Chaudhary, et al., 2016). Another example of food security issues is in Malaysia with challenges deriving from poverty and climate change which negatively impacted the food production (Alam, Siwar, & Wahid, 2018). Climate change is another factor that has been known to affect food security as there can be droughts, rising sea levels, and other natural disasters that negatively affect agriculture. The way that Malaysia was able to help their food security issues was through government investments in agriculture, providing subsidies to low-income families, as well as creating healthy and clean food rations (Alam, Siwar, & Wahid, 2018). While these are only a few nations it is evident that there are ways that governments have been able to manage the food security crises within their nation. Policy Recommendation One of the most impactful ways that a nation can help alleviate the food security crises they may be facing is to invest in their agriculture. While factors such as climate change can make this a more challenging approach, if successful not only will they aid with food security issues such as food prices but, they will also be able to provide jobs to those in poverty or unemployed while being able to enhance their economic situation. Within the readings it is shown that the investment in agriculture that it improves the GDP and by increasing food production it reduces food insecurity as well as the prices as governments are able to become more independent and raise their citizens above the global poverty line (Kolodziejczak & Pawlak, 2020). While this solution potentially has its problems it is able to solve a multitude of human security Sustainability Development Goals all at once. Bibliography Alam, M., Siwar, C., & Wahid, A. (2018).

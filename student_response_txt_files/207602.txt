Here is the next student submission: The most interesting thing I learned in this module would be the ongoing legal battle on copyright of generative AI works. For me copyright has never made complete since maybe if I owned a idea worth copying I would feel different. IP fraud has always been a thing, my mind immediate goes to Chinese knockoffs of American household products. In some cases I believe Intellectual property protection is necessary and in most cases I have a hard time understanding Its importance. For one example where I could understand Intellectual property protection is in defense contracting. We wouldn't want other nations gaining the upper hand off the hard work of US defense contractors reason being the national security would be a steak and defense weapons can be sold for a lot of money to allies. I guess that's what it a boils down to, money if people are using or coping your ideas there money to be made. Now entering the copyright argument is generative AI. I view AI as a helpful resource for Imprecation, brainstorming and a crutch for small independent creators. That's why I applauded the EU definition for copyright. As an artist before AI I remember scouring google images for a jumble of references that fit mostly fit my mental image of what I was trying to go for. Now with AI I can generate a reference that more closely fit my vision and I can build off from that. My takeaway is that laws need to be put in place from where AI gathers its knowledge base from and what sufficient work is needed to place a copyright claim (So not 100% AI generated work can be copyrighted). But also I need more understanding on copyright because It something we didn't cover a whole lot in class. What reading or viewing materials do you recommend so that I can better understand copyright.

"May 5 152 Total Words Hello Class, I take a multi-faceted approach to protect my online privacy. Firstly, I'm discerning about the platforms and services I use, opting for those with robust privacy policies and encryption practices. I make sure to review and adjust my privacy settings regularly to control the information I share. In terms of device security, I rely on reputable antivirus and anti-malware software to detect and prevent any malicious threats. Keeping my software and operating systems up to date with the latest security patches is also a priority to minimize vulnerabilities. When it comes to my home network, I prioritize router security. I change the default credentials to unique, strong passwords and enable encryption protocols like WPA2 or WPA3 to safeguard the data transmitted between devices and the router. Additionally, I regularly monitor router logs for any suspicious activity and adjust settings as needed to maintain a secure connection." "You made some very good points! Securing your home router is often an overlooked aspect of online privacy, but it's just as important. Changing default login credentials and enabling encryption protocols like WPA2 ensure that your Wi-Fi network remains inaccessible to unauthorized users. And regularly updating router firmware is essential for patching any vulnerabilities that could be exploited by cybercriminals. Great work!"

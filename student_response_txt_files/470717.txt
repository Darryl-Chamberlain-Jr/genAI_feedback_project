"I wanna start this off by saying something I feel we can all agree on, we live in a pretty nutty world, but everything has its ups and downs right? I strongly believe that we are in the greatest time to be alive in the history of the universe, and also the most confusing time to be alive. Technology is advancing at such a fast rate right now that my daughter (who will be born this month ðŸ˜Žbtw) may be able to be among the first humans to live essentially forever. Now that's just a theory but tomorrow they might tell us it's just a thing now. With all of this craziness we all have our own little piece of the internet that villains are constantly trying to steal from us. The few ways I try to keep me and my family safe is using a VPN for all of our electronics at home or on the go. I also try to change up my passwords for different sights so that if the bad guys get one they don't just immediately ruin my whole life lol. I'll end my rambling now, and thanks for reading!" "I agree that we all need to use strong passwords that will make it as difficult as possible for people to figure them out. I totally forgot about immediately updating software. Thank you for the post and have a great weekend." "I love the presentation you created to state all of the possible ways to stay safe online. It is extremely difficult in the time we live in to actually be 100% secure and private. Iam sure doing all of these safety procedures does the trick though! thanks for the post and have a great weekend."

"Hello Class, So currently I am staying on base so I would not have any safety measures as far as staying on base but if it would be a safety measure the only thing that really applies to me is having an our guard at the front gate. If I was staying off base, I would like to apply camera around the house and front door and also get a big but heavy safe. I would like the big safe just because people can't always pick up safe and camera to have views on what going on what part around my home have they been in. Having a phone I really don't use much other than vpn and having a passcode on my phone. Having VPN on your phone help conceals the internet data traveling to and from my phone. On my computer I use firewall, keep all my software up to date and the antivirus software current, have a passcode on the computer and lastly use the privacy windows on the browser." "Hello [name], I think you should consider using some kind of VPN or Firewall. I believe some apple products do have some time of File Vault that just protect the private or confidential information on your product. Not sure how good it is but it help with most people" Thanks for the information about the Norton software. I have AT&T for a router as well but sometimes that acts slow. But how does the smart home manager app works. I had one for back when I was in an apartment but it wasnâ€™t working for me.

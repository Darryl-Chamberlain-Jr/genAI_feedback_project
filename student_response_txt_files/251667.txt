"Hello everyone. So in the instructions it says to discuss how we protect ourselves internet wise and I am here to tell you, I don't. I suck at safeguarding my privacy on the internet. I have no idea what my security settings are on my router and honestly, the more I think about it, that scares me. I live on a military installation, we all live like right on top of each other and we all use the less than stellar base internet/wifi that they have. I feel like there is someone spying on my internet use now. Be warned spy, there is a lot of funny cat videos. I definitely think I just gave myself homework, like intensive homework to check/change all of my security settings to make sure my devices and internet use are all protected. You would think that having a father in law that works for a government contracted network security company, that I would have a better understanding of how to figure this stuff out." "Have no fear because you are doing way better than I am. I should probably change my passwords more often or even have them contained somewhere that I can look at them so I can at least remember what passwords I'm using. I have no idea even how to set up a VPN so from my perspective, you're doing great!" "I have also noticed this same thing, and I keep saying I'm going to do better about safeguarding my privacy. I have Alexa devices in my house that I synced mine and my husband's voice to so that it would recognize us, only to realize that they record everything that gets said. So not only does it hear us talk about anything under the sun, I have a young daughter now and I feel like it's hearing me talk to her and about her; that scares me. Thank you for reminding me to reset it and take our voices out of its programming.

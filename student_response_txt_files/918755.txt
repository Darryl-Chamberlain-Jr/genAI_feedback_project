"Good Afternoon class. Truthfully I do not use any further protection when utilizing the internet. The only protection I currently have is the security measures included with each Apple update. Apart from that I typically avoid clicking any random link I see and also avoid any new websites I haven't heard of before. Although I know it's a good practice to use as many security measures as possible when utilizing the internet, I believe most viruses, scams, and hacks come from clicking random links on social media, visiting websites that aren't reputable, and illegal streaming of movies or pay per view events. By avoiding these websites and streams in addition to Apple's security measures in each update I have been able to avoid viruses, hackers, and scams while surfing the web. Thinking about the topic now I will probably look into advanced security programs for my laptop, phone, and desktop." "Good Afternoon [name]. You did a great job pointing out the two-factor authentication. I completely forgot to mention this in my post. Two-factor authentication along with a strong password is a great way to ensure safety and security when using the internet, especially if you have personal info or debit/credit cards associated with the account." "Good Afternoon [name]. A VPN is a great security feature to use when using the internet, especially when using an unfamiliar public WIFI connection as you mentioned. A VPN can make it harder for a hacker to get your information, location, and gain access to what you're doing online."

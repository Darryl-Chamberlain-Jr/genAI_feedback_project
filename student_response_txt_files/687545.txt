One thing agreed upon is that some resources are finite; hence, why the term non-renewable resources is commonly used when discussing such things as fossil fuels. As the quantity of these resources becomes fewer, their value increases. This opens the door for the outbreak of conflict over control or access to them, such as gold, coltan, and even animals on the verge of extinction. As the Population Resource Bureau (2001) discusses, the availability of these resources becomes scarcer. The efforts are then made by a single group to monopolize them, often in the form of organized crime. This conquest for monopolizing resources has a degrading effect on that region's economy and other concerns, such as increased human security issues like poverty and violence. Environmental security issues as well, such as deforestation or extinction of a species, contribute to the decline of an ecosystem. The ability to even combat these efforts to monopolize resources is difficult. Glenny (2009), in his TED Talk appearance, shows how speed boats, which come with a hefty price tag, are used to import illegal goods into Italy. Glenny discusses how the Italian government is overwhelmed, and the ability to stop or even slow the illegal imports seems almost impossible at times because they do not have the finances to spend capital solely on the apprehension of the transportation of illicit imports into their country. As the problem of monopolizing continues to grow, so too do human and environmental concerns with it. Using the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) as an example to explain the correlation. The DRC "holds 80 percent of the world's reserves of coltan-a material used in microchips-and accounts for 51 percent of world coltan production" (Bergenas, et al., 2015). However, due to illicit mining in the area, the country loses the ability to make a profit and fund programs such as schooling and health (Bergenas et al., 2015). The evidence is clear: taking away a resource that belongs to a region takes more than just that resource. It takes away the ability of the region to sustain itself by addressing poverty, education, and infrastructure and even assists in delegitimizing governments.  Expanding on the last point of delegitimizing a government. This is a significant concern for the United States (US) and creates national security concerns. Harris (2013) states that our lifestyles and the demands of consumerism to support an affluent lifestyle damage the planet. Our (the US) demand for oil to fuel our daily lives has created a vulnerability, one exploited by terrorist groups such as the Islamic State. "According to a UN Security Council sanctions committee report late last year, illicit oil sales were the Islamic State's largest revenue source" (Bergenas et al., 2015). The US demand for oil has helped line the pockets of terrorist groups committed to the downfall of the US. The US demand for oil created an opportunity for Islamic State terrorist groups to have some control over oil export, thus, creating a situation where the US has helped finance the same group they declared war on in 2001.

"Dec 7, 2023 2:32PM [name]  Good Afternoon Class,   As a reminder, I chose to discuss the COVID-19 pandemic as my crisis in Module 1. The COVID-19 pandemic is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.  The virus took the world by storm and the pandemic plagued the world beginning in March of 2020 (World Health Organization, n.d.).  The limitation between face-to-face contact and unfamiliarity of the virus created chaos within communities while unveiling vulnerabilities throughout response, governmental, and healthcare fields communications plans. With the introduction of social media in recent years, the reliance as a means of communicating key information became the basis of the pandemic which in turn was coined the “infodemic”.  The relationship between the surge of misinformation and social media was substantial in comparison to more traditional methods such as news channels (Bridgman, Merkley, Loewen, Owen, Ruths, Teichmann, & Zhilin, 2020). The contrast of the two avenues of communication reflects a more favorable light on traditional news versus the latter.  Treating accessibility of information through social media as a “double-edged” sword due to the inaccuracy and rate at which it was disseminated making it impossible to recover.    Discuss the moral implications of risk communication and identify situations in which ethical/legal responsibilities were broken.   Moral implications of risk communications are a critical element of the process and can dictate not only efficiency of operations but also longevity.  Both elements are contingent upon transparency of responding agencies, inclusivity, and establishing that element of trust between the public while maintaining control of the narrative, ensuring not to increase further panic.    However, these fundamental elements were not present during the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, an ethical responsibility that was broken was the exclusion of individuals of Asian descent.  The actions of Asian prejudice were apparent in community lifelines such as educational institution and throughout media platforms.  Specific to Australia, actions included a variation of containment measures that primarily focused on Chinese students that outlined a controversial segregated quarantine (Guttman & Lev, 2021).   Another aspect of risk communications that caused ethical/legal responsibilities to be broken was the choice to withhold information causing a delay in risk communication and transparency with the public.  This would in turn, deprive the public the opportunity to self-determine and instill the confidence to create the environment necessary for establishing that relationship of trust in emergency response efforts.    Consider what happened in the situation, the short and long-term effects, and how these effects might be mitigated in a future situation (i.e., what could have been done better).   As mentioned previously, the short-term and also long-term effects that have resulted in the delay of risk communications during the pandemic is the publics distrust in both science, healthcare professionals, emergency response, and governmental agencies. This delay also caused not only distrust but also long-term health impacts for some individuals and inevitably death for others.  With the pandemic and loss in trust being recent, it will take quite some time for our communities to recover and build that trust.    Mitigation of future instances can be addressed by taking a proactive stance by communicating early on with the public and areas of the population that are most vulnerable to the sickness in question can establish that critical baseline for trust. Providing insight to areas that are being addressed, measures that are being implemented, and facilitate this approach.    References   Bridgman, A., Merkley, E., Loewen, P.

I find it great that we chose to discuss the same topic because it provides multiple views points on a subject that is experience based.  Generally, everyone had the same experience during the pandemic but individually everyone's experience is different.  Therefore, having the opportunity to hear everyone's story and identify their unmet needs helps us to better understand our areas of vulnerability to better mitigate future events.    Thank you, it was definitely an overwhelming amount of information making it extremely difficult to decipher.  As you said, many people were more inclined to believe even the most obvious of misinformation, but I try to be mindful because of their vulnerable state of mind. All we can do is be better going forward!   Respectfully,   [name] from Module 8 Discussion: Ethics and Outcomes (AI Enhanced Assignment) 13 hours ago [name]  Good Evening [name],   It is always great to hear another native’s perspective on hazards that are prone to the State of Florida.   Many of the times, individuals forget that these are predictions and not just during Hurricane Ian but many prior storms just a slight shift to the left or right can alter the path completely.  My organization works hand-in-hand along with the National Weather Service to provide the most accurate information to not only the community but to our partners as well so that it can help us to navigate our next steps.    I agree many of the terms such as the “cone of uncertainty” makes it extremely difficult to place trust in weather predictions especially if they can shift at any given moment.  Many times predictions are reliant on historical data and a multitude of variables, making them just that predictions. I know personally it is difficult to coordinate messaging when everyone’s preference of source is different.  However, it is key to partner with media agencies, push plain messaging formats, and utilize all platforms to push a unified message.  For example, one of the greatest resources available are the public advisories issued by the National Weather Service.  They are written to address key areas of an event.  These include: watches and warnings, discussion and outlook, summary of information, key details of conditions, and when the next advisory will be available.  The message is formatted in plain language.    I agree that even with the most effective of messaging there will always be unforeseen circumstances that cannot easily be mitigated.  However, moving forward it will be the job of responders to easily pivot to these types of circumstances and better prepare by staging resources in anticipation of prior use.  This should also be conveyed to the public to avoid further concern.    Great job!   Respectfully,   [name] from Module 8 Discussion: Ethics and Outcomes (AI Enhanced Assignment) 13 hours ago [name]  Good Evening [name],   Great job on your discussion post response.  As a professional that works for a local agency, I am all too familiar with controlling the narrative through public trust.  Accurate, routine, and transparent communication with the public is typically the easiest way to gain this.  Cooperation of the public will determine the efficiency and effectiveness in the individual phases of emergency management.  As you said it sometimes difficult to find the happy medium of informational accuracy and being able to quickly pump out information to the public.    As you highlighted in great detail, one aspect of risk communications that many forget about is internally across responding agencies.  Not only is a operational issue but also is a cause for concern with public messaging and gaining that trust previously discussed.  Long-term effects can be detrimental to relations between local agencies and the community as seen in the East Palestine train derailment.  Rebuilding that trust will be a long and hard road.  While it will be difficult, it is important to remain persistent and mindful moving forward to address those areas of opportunity that previously strained relations.    Respectfully,   [name]"

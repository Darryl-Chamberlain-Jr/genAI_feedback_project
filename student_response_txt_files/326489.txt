The challenges posed by an electricity-reliant national security system for energy policy are multifaceted and require a comprehensive approach to address energy security and climate change objectives. According to Toke & Vezirgiannidou (2013), the divergent approaches to energy security and climate change between nations, such as the EU prioritizing climate-change objectives and others focusing on access and affordability, complicate global climate treaty negotiations. This divergence can impede progress towards a global climate deal, potentially pushing the 2°C target further out of reach. Countries like France, Brazil, and Russia have distinct energy preferences, such as nuclear energy, biofuels, and natural gas, respectively, which further complicate negotiations (Toke & Vezirgiannidou, 2013). The over-reliance on electricity also presents homeland security challenges, particularly for the United States and its allies. The U.S. electric grid, based on aging technology, is vulnerable to a range of threats, including severe weather, physical attacks, and cyberattacks (CNA Military Advisory Board, 2015). Between 2011 and 2014, electric utilities reported 362 targeted attacks, including 14 cyberattacks, highlighting the increasing risk to the grid's reliability and security. Such vulnerabilities have direct implications for national security, affecting sectors crucial for economic growth, communication, transportation, health, and emergency services. Moreover, the interdependence of various sectors on electricity amplifies the impact of power disruptions. As highlighted by the CNA Military Advisory Board (2015), large-scale power outages can lead to cascading failures across critical infrastructure, disrupting essential services and potentially causing social unrest. The reliance on centralized power generation and transmission infrastructure further exacerbates these vulnerabilities, making the grid susceptible to both small and large-scale outages. In conclusion, the challenges posed by an electricity-reliant national security system require a coordinated approach to enhance energy security while mitigating climate change impacts. Efforts to diversify energy sources, improve grid resilience, and enhance cybersecurity are essential to ensure a reliable and secure electricity supply. Furthermore, international collaboration and consensus-building are crucial to address the divergent energy preferences and priorities of different nations and advance towards meaningful climate treaty agreements (Toke & Vezirgiannidou, 2013; CNA Military Advisory Board, 2015).

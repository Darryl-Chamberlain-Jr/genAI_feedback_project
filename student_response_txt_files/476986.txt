"Good Evening Class, This may be an unpopular opinion but I personally do not have very big concerns around the protection of privacy as it is very simple to remain anonymous on most online services and there are protections already in place on your behalf for things like account security in almost every major online service. There are no particular measures that I take to safeguard my devices except try to avoid public wifi. I might also argue that going out of your way to protect devices or retain privacy is almost pointless as companies will collect and sell your data regardless of measures such as VPN or antivirus products. The whole basis of ads on Instagram and Facebook is data sold then regurgitated to sell individual products to users on those platforms. The only real way to be complete secure and private is to discontinue any use of online products and yes, even Google. References Staff in the Office of Technology. (2022, January 27).

I could not say the same as I honestly hardly pay attention to online privacy but I can appreciate how others might feel that it is necessary." " Good Afternoon [name], You make an excellent point about the use of a guest account on devices and online accounts. The ability to create a guest account is something I've often overlooked but does make sense in relation remaining secure and protecting your data."

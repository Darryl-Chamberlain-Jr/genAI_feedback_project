Climate Change and Destabilization Environmental and climate change crimes greatly impact global safety and stability (United Nations, 2021). Since human activities affect natural systems, crime increases, which threatens US security (National Security Council, 2018). Resource-based conflict, environmental degradation, and political and economic destabilization are three major human impacts on the environment. These activities degrade the environment and fuel national and international security issues. Explain the destabilizing influences that result from resource-based conflict.  Resource conflicts occur when there is competition over resources like water and arable land that are scarce, which then, causes tension and violence. According to Kelley et al. (2015), the Syrian drought shows how environmental factors can increase socio-economic vulnerabilities, leading to social unrest, migration, and conflict. Unsustainable agricultural practices and bad governance worsened the drought effect in Syria, which led to political instability and violent extremists. Unpredictability threatens regional security and U.S. national security, including terrorism and refugee influx. Identify the growing role that the natural environment plays in contributing to or causing political and /or economic destabilization within a country or within a region.  The changing role of the natural environment makes it one of the critical sources of political and economic instability in various countries and regions. Bergenas and Knight (2015) state that environmental degradation can weaken governance, worsen social inequality and increase illegal logging and wildlife trafficking. Weak governance and corruption exacerbate these issues, fostering transnational crime and terrorism. Instability in countries like this can lead to terrorism, illicit trafficking, and the spread of infectious diseases, which could lead to US intervention to ensure security and prevent conflict escalation. Analyze how political or economic destabilization can lead to security concerns for the U.S. Environmental pressures posing political or economic destabilization risks also jeopardize US security interests. Harris (2013) posited that regions with failed states or governance can spawn extreme ideologies and criminal enterprises, threatening regional and global stability. Economic instability may destabilize global markets, hurting US trade and finance. Diplomacy, humanitarian aid, and strategic partnerships can address such security concerns and promote stability, good governance, and climate change mitigation. In conclusion, environmental crimes and security issues require strategic action. We can fix these issues with sustainable development, governance consolidation, and environmental resilience. International cooperation and multilateral agreements are necessary to combat transnational environmental crimes and maintain global peace. Addressing root causes can boost US security and align with a world without environmental degradation and instability.  References Bergenas, J., & Knight, A. (2015).

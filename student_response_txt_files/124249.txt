"Class, I take several precautions to keep my internet usage private. My first course of action, particularly when utilizing public Wi-Fi, is to encrypt my internet connection using a VPN. Using antivirus software to guard against malware, spyware, and other internet dangers is another measure I take. I also ensure that two-factor authentication is enabled on all of my accounts and I never keep my passwords on public computers. My router's security isn't quite as extensive. Whenever I move, I always change the default username and password as an initial precaution. In addition, I keep an eye out for firmware updates for my router, which generally include security patches that fix identified weaknesses in my network and shield me from potential attacks. Collectively, my efforts put up a relatively solid front for anyone attempting to obtain my data. Still, there's always space for improvement when it comes to protecting your privacy." "@[name] actually interesting how many things these days have software updates. My mouse, keyboard, and even headset all regularly have updates as well has just about every component of my computer. Definitely look into all of your hardware associated with your PC and internet and make sure all of your components are up to date, If you ever find your computer sluggish check for updates on your parts!" Keeping things you do not want on the internet is actually a very good security that many of us sometimes forget is the best practice. Having two emails for important/risky stuff is actually smart, I've never really considered that. Great ideas!

"My approach to protecting my privacy and information online can be summed up by saying: I assume anything I put on the internet is public information. I try to refrain from storing sensitive information digitally because there is so many unknowns when it comes to data privacy. I also try to share information on the internet as little as possible and never opt to 'optionally' put in any extra information about me. I also have a couple different email accounts that I use. The reason for this is so I can keep a primary email for important personal use as well as a backup email for if I'm not sure about the security of the website I'm putting it into or if i think i will receive a lot of spam mail from them. I also try not have repeated passwords for different websites so if one is compromised it doesn't compromise everything else." "Hi [name], you have a very common sense type approach to internet security which i like. I relate to what you are saying in the sense that you don't go out of your way to add extra precautions, I also just try to use my best judgment and avoid anything that looks suspicious but i also try not to store sensitive information digitally which makes me a little less worried." "Hi [name], I like your emphases on the importance of a good password. I think the importance of having a unique password is understated in general. It is a scary thought that if someone was able to access one password they could access all your other online information if passwords were not unique."

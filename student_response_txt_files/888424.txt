"Hello Everybody Internet privacy is something I take very seriously. There are many ways and techniques I use to secure my internet connection and ensure my privacy is protected.

This is accomplished by simple network setting on the devices. I also use a paid subscription of AVG internet security which controls any threats to my computer or me. I also have windows defender running which acts as another great barrier. I also run scheduled scans and clean my devices as needed. When it comes to the use of an account online, I ensure to have a mix of password options so it will not be easy to be completely hacked into. A secondary security system like SMS code or Duo push to approve certain access to some of my account has been set up. My network router setting are set up as such recommended by ISP. I use a Netgear router and my access is set for WPA and WPA2 for my wireless connections. My WiFi is secured with a password. I also have setup a program on my computer which shows if any other devices are connected to or is using my network.

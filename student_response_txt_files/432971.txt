Good morning, I will be evaluating the students work for question 1. First off, there were several errors and thus he did not arrive at the correct solution. First we will Convert the decimal into a fraction: sin(\theta)=-\frac{8431}{10000} Now we need to isolate \thetaand to do that we will use the inverse functions of \arcsin \theta=\arcsin\left(-\frac{8431}{10000}\right) Since there are two angles in the interval \left(180^{\circ},360^{\circ}\right)so next we will find the value of 180^{\circ} \theta=180^{\circ}-\arcsin\left(-\frac{8431}{10000}\right) Since the function is periodic, we will add the period of 360^{\circ}K,K\in\mathbb{Z}which is \theta=180^{\circ}-\arcsin\left(-\frac{8431}{10000}\right)+360^{\circ}k,k\in\mathbb{Z} Now we need to solve for \theta: \theta=180^{\circ}+\arcsin\left(\frac{8431}{10000}\right)+360^{\circ}k,k\in\mathbb{Z} Now we see that the answer is \theta=237.5^{\circ} I hope that everyone has been able to follow along with my example in this discussion. I do find it hard to explain the calculations that I am doing when using a graphing calculator, but I hope that I didi my best to explain my rationalizing. Have a great weekend everyone, [name]

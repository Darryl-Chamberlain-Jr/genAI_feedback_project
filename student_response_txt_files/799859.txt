Transnational Crime and Environmental Insecurity Analyze the three most detrimental ways humans have impacted environmental systems (including climate change) resulting directly in rising levels of transnational crime 	Humans have impacted the global landscape of environmental security for decades, with the advancement of technology aiding these efforts. In the year 2009, roughly fifteen percent of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) was contributed to organized crime, with the help of technology (Glenny, 2009). Eastern Europe, such as the Balkans region, and Mexico, serve as prime distribution regions for transnational criminal activities, such as prostitution and heroin. Across the countries where distribution is heavy, violence and conflict are in high occurrence. As a result, the environmental security of the region is impacted negatively, due to the consequences endured via physical destruction of lands caused by warfare, as well as the overuse of land and natural resources during the process of cultivating and distributing organized criminal networks.  Identify how each action results in straining US national security concerns: Explain the destabilizing influences that result from resource-based conflict U.S. national security is strained as a result of organized crime, which strains environmental security, through the production and distribution of organized crime products and services that occur within the U.S. Where politicians and officials once left the task of environmental protection largely with affiliated agencies, environmental crime is driving the need for politicians and officials to participate in enhanced collaborative efforts (Bergenas & Knight, 2015). As a result, these collaborative efforts will offer less strain on US national security concerns, as continuity is gained on key topics concerning environmental insecurity, due to environmental crime.  Examples of destabilizing influences over populations of people consist of natural disasters, inaccessibility to clean water, and frequent patterns of migration (Harris, 2013). As a result, this contributes to instability and environmental insecurity, through resource-based conflict.  Identify the growing role that the natural environment plays in contributing to or causing political and /or economic destabilization within a country or within a region 	The natural environment plays a large role in contributing to political and economic destabilization, through environmental insecurity. Populations of people rely on the resources that the natural environment provides. Often, organized crime takes advantage of such resources for the profit of their organized criminal activity. In turn, this brews chaos, violence, and instability, making it difficult for politicians and law enforcement professionals to curb, control and discourage such activity (Bergenas & Knight, 2015). For example, in the Bahamas, illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing activities and drug trafficking have been linked together by the US Department of State (Bergenas & Knight, 2015). This offers an example of how the natural environment contributes to instability across environmental security.  Analyze how political or economic destabilization can lead to security concerns for the U.S. 	Political and economic destabilization can lead to US security concerns through the concept of lack of collaboration and continuity between officials and affiliated agencies. The need for officials to focus on the matters involving their state, while also staying fully attuned to the matters involving national and international concerns is growing in importance (Harris, 2013). Without this ability, rendered by local and state officials, collaborative efforts will perhaps continue to fall short.   References Bergenas, J., & Knight, A. (2015).

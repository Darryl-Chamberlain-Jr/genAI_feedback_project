"My approach to Protecting my privacy when online... It can be annoying sometimes, but it is worth it! Using strong, unique passwords for my accounts. Each password is different in some way. I utilize “Passwords” on my apple products to keep track of my accounts and passwords. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) whenever possible. Regularly update software on my devices. Using a secure network or VPN when I don’t have a secure network. I tend to stay away from websites that are not well known or sorced. I regularly back up my data on my computer. My router Security settings: I have a WPA2/WPA3 encryption that secures my network. I have a customized username and password for my WiFi. I have a separate guest network that isolates guest devices from my primary network. This helps reduce the risk of unauthorized access. I also use the firewall feature to monitor network traffic."

Your effort towards privacy and security are on point!" "I appreciate your straightforward take on internet privacy and security.

These days it's incredibly hard to be fully secure, but every little bit helps!

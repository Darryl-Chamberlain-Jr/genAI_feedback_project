 "Here we are yet again for another discussion and this time about privacy with our PEDs. A very simple thing that I do to protect my privacy is I don't use public WIFI systems, I will connect to my cell phone's personal hot spot and use internet that way. That is how I am able to log into my laptop in my command when I have down time between maintenance and that is precisely what I am doing now. I don't have my phone's airdrop on everybody, all of my social media is set to private or only friend's and family. Like I said in a previous discussion that advancements in technology are both a blessing and a cure, it is a double edge sword with on side of the blade having poison and everything venomous. As security measures become increasingly more proactive at keeping would be identity thieves at bay, so to does their advancements in hacking become increasingly more dynamic as well. Google admitted to people's devices listening to conversations in the room to better assist people with ads on what they wanted more based on an algorithm. I had a similar situation one time in late 2019 early 2020 right before the plandemic, my command was in Air Wing Fallon for about 6 weeks. I was working in the airframe shop on night check from 1800-0600 and we were having a conversation about the S & W .500 Magnum and one of the guys logged onto the computer and got on facebook and the very first video that popped up on his feed was the exact same gun, the exact same make, the exact same youtube video came up. Everyone in the shop said $%#$ that and we all put our phone on airplane mode or turned them off. We knew as a collective that big tech spys on people to "better enhance" their experience but they also sell our information to foreign entities and next thing you know you get spam mail, spam callers and more and more ads on your feed. I limit the use of technology in my household for good reason, especially when we find out the google maps vehicle is on the road. Nope, they aren't spying on me through my wifi. Protect yourself at all costs especially when it comes to electronics and the information that can be stolen from you via electronics." "I agree with you Jacolby on using a VPN for your laptops and updating your passwords whenever possible. I too fall into the trap of using familiar passwords, but in my defence I have a lot of shit on my plate so if it is easier to remember a familiar password then so be it. Do make sure your home wifi is set to privacy, turn off your airdop whenever in public. I've been on two different deployments on two different carriers and I learned that if you don't wan t something airdropped to your phone on the boat turn your airdrop off, lol. Great post brother, keep it up." "Can't say I miss the good ol' barracks wifi but that was trash and slow as hell. My roommate had gotten his own internet with wifi cuz he was a gamer and I found his password so I used it lol, barracks life. Yeah, I don't like the fact that every app you download you have to ask it not to use your location ever, not to give you updates etc. these apps are becoming too much like a trojan horse and you don't know what is inside of the app until it is too late. Using the VPN feature is huge when it comes to privacy because it does make it harder for people to try to get your information. Like the Iphones iOS 17 update when there was a warning about the name drop feature with another phone that was near by. I happened to me and I made sure I turned off that feature. Good job Tyler, keep it up."

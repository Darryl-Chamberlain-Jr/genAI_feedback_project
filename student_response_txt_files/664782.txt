"When it comes to protecting and safeguarding my computer and other devices, in all honesty I don't do much. However, I also don't do much to put myself at risk. I try to keep a small social profile online and don't post too many pictures containing myself or info about my life unless its car or motorcycle related. I also don't share where I'm at like a lot of people tend to do. as for my devices, I don't stay up to date on software updates like I should. So that does create a security risk there, however I don't use my devices for much. For the most part I google some stuff, stream apps such as YouTube and Disney+, and I pay my bills. I never engage sketchy emails, text, or calls. I never click random links when surfing the internet and those that pop up on websites and cell phone games. Also, across all of my accounts, all of my passwords are random and don't contain common info from my life. As far as at home router security goes, I have a very unique password, and even though I have the unfortunate opportunity to only have Cox as my Wi-Fi provider, they do offer an enhanced security option which I did turn on. To be honest, I'm not completely sure what it does exactly. Lastly, every once in a while, I will also go through my connected and unconnected devices on my Cox app and scan for devices I do not recognize, as well as pretty much kick all of the devices listed off and go through and reconnect them when necessary." "Me and you are pretty similar. Although I will say I don't use a VPN as much as I should. I'm really curious how many people actually change their passwords that often. I get it's a good safety practice, however it is also very inconvenient. Especially if you already have a strong password to begin with." "Your security measures are what I dream of... if I had the energy and mental capacity to pull it off. Almost makes me want to hire you to set up my stuff. I will definitely take note of your router security settings though as that's where I do spend most of my time online.

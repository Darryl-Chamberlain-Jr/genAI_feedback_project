"Good evening class, I am a frequent flyer, constantly having to travel for work and due to me being overseas this is well needed to get extra training for my job. I bring my laptop with me to either touch up on some work that I kind of forgot about or haven't work on. In addition, I try to stay updated with my schoolwork so while in flight I work on them to kill time while in flight. Stating the obvious there isn't any service being in the air so naturally, I connect to the airlines Wi-Fi. Yes, it is kind of expensive and yes it is an open network so there is always a potential for someone to spy on whatever you are doing and steal information. As a contingency, I paid and installed "Nord VPN". This application allows me to hide my IP address, hide my current location, and to make my connection to a Wi-Fi more secure. In short, to have a safer experience whilst being online. Relating to security, when it comes to my router at home, I try to keep it simple. Being simple doesn't mean be sloppy and have a weak security setup, you should invest in your router constantly. For myself, I have a very long password that I have to write down because I can not simply remember it off the top of my head. For myself i am very paranoid about security due to the amount of times that I get hacked. I seem to be very unlucky or just careless in some way. In result I went ahead and installed a third party firmware, "DD-WRT". This will strengthen not only the capabilities of your router but will replace the default firmware so make it more secure and protect all of your private information. Good thing about it, is that it is free!" "Regarding the topic that was covered, using a VPN feels almost crucial these days due to people always wanting to steal your information. I use Nord VPN and was wondering what kind of VPN you utilize. I am so bad at clicking pop ups because they can sometimes be very convincing that I need to have a coffee mug. Great job on this post, Felt relatable to me because I also go on planes a lot so I typically bring my personal laptop for work/entertainment." "So my only question about "WhatsApp" is this, due to its alleged ability to be encrypted, does this restrict the creator/ developer of the app from accessing messages? Myself being in the barracks I use to live the struggle of having boingo but then later switched to buying my own router due to the ability to have a private connection. This will allow you to install a third party firmware into it, this will in result better your security. Great job on your post, really cracked me up on the comment of how it knows where you are even when it shouldn't.

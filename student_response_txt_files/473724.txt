"Good afternoon class, My approach to protecting my privacy online used to be "incognito mode". I thought that my privacy was protected by using that. I also thought that apps wouldn't be able to send me ads for stuff I looked up when I was "incognito". It turns out that Google has admitted to tracking data while incognito and has a lawsuit against them. "Google would track users and collect their data while they were browsing privately" (Brokin, 2024). Since I've started using my computers more often I purchased a VPN from Total AV. Along with the VPN, I have a full computer security program from Total AV that was included as a package deal. This gives my devices at home security, like encrypted file sharing and actual browsing privacy. I have the ability to turn it on and off. I also have numerous benefits from utilizing the VPN, my favorite is that the VPN app allows me to select where I would like to connect from, states, cities, and even countries, and with that I can stream Netflix shows that aren't available in US Netflix. I may also get better Amazon pricing. For my router, I don't have anything going on special. It has the same username and password that was given to me by my internet provider. I know I should change it and I've tried like 5 times but for some reason, it won't stick. I'll have to call the provider one of these days." " I also use a VPN for the majority of my streaming. I'm curious about which VPN you use. I have an iPhone so creating new passwords for things is relatively easy because the iPhone will suggest a strong password for you and then keep your saved passwords in your settings. So even if you forget, or log in on another device, you can find them all in one place. " "You have a protocol. You are dialed in on your defenses in cyber security. It's honestly given me more insight on what I can do to protect my cyber awareness. However, I do not think it necessary for me to add another network for guests, because I don't have a spare bedroom, and that means people cant stay long. lol"

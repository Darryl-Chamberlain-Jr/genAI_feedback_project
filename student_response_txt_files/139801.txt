"Dec 7, 2023 12:46AM [name]  Only two fatalities were recorded after the Marshall Fire had finally calmed enough for people to return to their homes. For an area that evacuated over 30,000 residents, this number is impressive. Little to no notice was given for the evacuations as local emergency notifications systems were not in place at the time, an opt-in system named Everbridge was used instead, but only about 24% of Boulder County were registered to receive those messages (Staeger & Bergum, 2023). Evacuation orders came quickly, and people had very little time to gather themselves and get to safety. According to the University of Colorado Boulder, over a thousand animals were killed throughout the Marshall Fire emergency, not being able to evacuate with their owners (Marshall, 2022).   Ethically, people are to be given the option to weigh the risk of their safety by sheltering in their own homes. Other considerations are to the presence of residents with disabilities or the elderly, some requiring additional assistance during evacuation as well as help to interpret evacuation notifications. Edna Turnbull, one of the two fatalities was tragically killed while re-entering her home to retrieve her dogs, both her and the other fatality were over the age of 65 (McKinley & Pearce, 2023). While no notable ethical or legal principles were broken, the effects of the fire losses were great.   Risk communications and their moral implications, especially in a disaster such as the Marshall Fire are that if not completely correctly, and timely, the risk to life increases. Not only do the events of the Marshall Fire apply to human life, but they also apply to other life forms as well. The psychological impacts of worrying about an animal or even upon finding out about their loss increase the stress on a community and are detrimental to recovery. Additionally, the inherent stressors of losing one’s home only multiply the effects felt after a disaster. Communication failures during this time, while seemingly harmless, have great implications as to the required safe evacuation time and eventually, with the means to evacuate people and animals alike.   Long- and short-term effects of the fire included over a thousand homes destroyed in Colorado’s most devastating fire but the animal losses were felt much more deeply (Marshall, 2022). The speed at which emergency notifications as well as evacuation orders show that the high animal death rate is not on behalf of factors leading to pet-owner relationships (Irvine & Andre, 2022). Recommendations for the future are to include pets and animals in emergency planning. It is conceded, however, that even this may not be enough. It is important to spread out communications over a broad spectrum in varying formats. Everbridge notifications could not have worked as only part of the population opted in for notifications. Another challenge with this incident was the timing, occurring during the holidays, when people were out shopping or out of the area, and could not have been able to evacuate their animals. Ethically, however, this should not prevent planning from considering these as factors as well. References   Irvine, L., & Andre, C. (2022).

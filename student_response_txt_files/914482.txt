Hello class, I will be doing Q.2 To start off the problem the student made the mistake of not plugging in the correct things for the formula that they used. This is the correct formula, but there is other stuff to figure in with it. Even if the formula would have been correct in the very last step of his problem they did not figure the math correct. V=R x W W=2r\pi f Which can be substituted as W=d\pi f with d=diameter and f= revolutions per minute W=\left(11in\right)\left(3300\frac{rev}{\min}\right)\pi W=36300\pi\frac{in}{\min} To figure out the velocity we have to convert and figure V=36300\pi\frac{in}{\min}\left(\frac{1mi}{63360in}\right)\left(\frac{60\min}{1hr}\right)       V=\frac{\left(36300)\left(60\right)\pi\right)}{63360}mph     V\approx108mph The student did not do enough research into the problem to correctly complete it. If the student would have spent more time studying up on a problem like this he would have been much closer to the correct answer. The student did not provide the corrected work. It was incorrect from the very beginning and the student was not even figuring the math correctly with the numbers he did use.

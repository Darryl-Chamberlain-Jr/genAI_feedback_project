Here is the next student submission: One of the things that I was most surprised to learn was how much AI doesn’t know. After reading the 3rd page of our reading assignment, I realized that if AI doesn’t have access to specific information you tend to get incorrect answers. This is how I learned the term “Hallucinating” when it comes to AI specifically. So, in theory, if the AI can’t get the exact information, it will give you the closest thing to it. When it comes to which communication technology has the most significant impact on human history, I would have to go with the switch to Web 2.0. When we made this switch, we gave everyone in the world with a computer and internet access the ability to publish information. This gave us the ability to connect with people on the other side of the planet, along with posting our own opinions and information on the web. This can be a double-edged sword, we can have access to very valuable information and access to very malicious information. I think that most digital communications represent something that is reimagined. For example, GIFs are just very short clips of videos that we use to communicate with each other. So instead of a cave painting to express an emotion, we have a short video that has the same impact. A question that I have is what is the final goal of AI? Are we going to rely on it to take over jobs that are not healthy or beneficial for humans to be doing? Is it something that everybody will depend on in the future? I enjoy listening to podcasts done by Lex Friedman, who is an American computer scientist. He has done a lot of videos breaking down how AI works and the different abilities that it has. I plan on continuing this to be up to speed on current AI advancements and other computer science and communication technologies. Here is the next student submission: In this module, we discussed some recent innovations in communication technology. I decided to focus on the evolution of the web for the QQC. Learning about the history of the Internet and World Wide Web gave me a deeper understanding of how much innovation and progress has occurred over the years. I wouldn't be taking this online class without that evolution! Understanding the differences between Web 1.0 and Web 2.0 also sheds light on the intricacies of the web. The most fascinating topic was AI. After reviewing the materials, I don't have a definitive stance on AI and LLMs. They are powerful but are they accurate and factual? The technology is still in its early stages, so it's hard to gauge the exact impact on future communication tech. The curated exhibit and peer review were highlights this week. I enjoyed researching and exploring the illuminated manuscripts and comparing colour palettes, fonts, and structures across different regions and religions. Reading peers' exhibits and statements gave me ideas to implement in my own project. Critiquing others' work was challenging when my own work isn't perfect. But I tried to focus on these being drafts, not final projects. Finally, the Apply Your Knowledge using AI was an interesting, unorthodox assignment after just learning about AI and LLMs in the QQC. Overall, this module introduced me to thought-provoking innovations that I look forward to learning more about. One question I still have is: How quickly will LLMs and AI progress from here? Will they rapidly transform communication and other fields in the near future, or will development be more gradual? I'm very interested to follow advancements in AI and see how quickly these technologies evolve. Their potential is vast, but there are also risks and unknowns that need to be navigated carefully.

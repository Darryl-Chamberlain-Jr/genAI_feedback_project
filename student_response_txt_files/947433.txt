Through the readings within this module, the four border crossing issues I identified are the treatment of migrants at the border and within detention facilities, handling the number of people crossing the U.S.-Mexico border every day, length of stays in detention facilities, and smuggling drugs and weapons.  The treatment and living conditions of migrants at the border and in detention centers is arguably a humanitarian crisis. With overcrowded shelters, lack of basic necessities, and even families being separated, there are many issues to address. On the webpage Freedom For Immigrants, they discussed how their most reported type of abuse is medical neglect, with the second being nutrition issues (Freedom for Immigrants, 2018). With many of the shelters and detention centers being privately owned, I propose that there should be more federal oversight on ensuring that the conditions in the centers are not deplorable. Ensuring that immigrants are fed, medically treated, and children remain with their parents should be a required policy for each center.  Border Patrol is likely overwhelmed with the amount of people attempting to cross the border, both legally and illegally. With small amounts of crew, low employee retention, overcrowded entry ports, and an overflow of people attempting to cross, Border Patrol is stretched thin, and it is contributing to the number of undocumented immigrants entering, as well as extremely long wait times. My proposal for this issue is to raise the budget for Border Patrol, allowing them to focus on recruiting more agents. More agents at entry ports will help ease the process, as well as allow for more surveillance across different frequent entry points.  The duration of time that many immigrants spend in detention centers, jails, and prisons is incredibly high. Data from Freedom for Immigrants showed that the longest average time spent was at Sherburne County Jail in Minnesota, with an average of 259 days (Freedom for Immigrants, 2018). While there are multiple reasons for this, one of the biggest issues is the privatization of many of these facilities. This allows the owners to generate income from the facilities and often leads to individuals being incarcerated for extended periods of time for increased revenue. I propose that if we cannot decrease the amount of facilities that are privately owned, we greatly increase the amount of federal oversight of these facilities. Enforcing a maximum stay, as well as oversight of the living conditions of the people housed there is crucial for the reduction of these wait times and the profitability of the facilities.  With so many people crossing the U.S.-Mexico border every day, there are large amounts of illegal drugs, weapons, and illegal human smuggling that occur even every few seconds. Many argue against immigration due to these conditions, saying that immigration increases this. However, I feel like this is something that could also be addressed by an increase in Border Patrol agents. By increasing staff numbers and the amount of individuals on patrol, it can help to check each vehicle and have more individuals patrolling less-populated areas. I can imagine that some of these issues would not go over well, especially with the individuals who own the private facilities. While it may not be easy, I think that these changes would be highly beneficial to improve not only the border crossing experience but the treatment of immigrants as well.

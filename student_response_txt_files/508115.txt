"Good afternoon class, The main thing I ensure to keep up to date on my personal computers at home is anti virus software. Usually, computers have some type of built in firewall or anti virus software. Personally, I mainly rely on Norton AntiVirus, which I signed up for when I purchased my computer. You can choose from a variety of different plans, which offer different levels of protection and features. I chose the cheapest version, but it helps me when browsing the internet. If I click on an unknown or suspicious website, the software will pop on on my screen and let me know that it is potentially unsafe to be on that website. Being in the Navy, I often visit government websites. For whatever reason, whenever I go to these websites, my antivirus software will notify me that this website could be unsafe to visit or could be wanting to steal information. I'm assuming it is because these websites are far more secure than some other websites on the internet." "I also use antivirus software which gives me some peace of mind browsing the internet. One thing I did not think of was using a VPN when using a public internet, but it is something that I will definitely consider using in the future. I often overlook protecting myself, but hopefully this will help educate myself a bit more." "I also use anti virus software on my personal computer, but something I never thought of was how my actual Wi-Fi router could be subject to malicious software or attacks. This is something I will look at in the future when shopping for an internet provider, and should take into account how protected their equipment is."

What challenges does an electricity-reliant national security system pose for energy policy?   There are many challenges for an electricity reliant national security system when considering energy policy. A country like America relies heavily on power production for all aspects of life. Power grids are rigid, aging, and often inefficient power methods for communities and military installations (CNA Military Advisory Board, 2015). There are many vulnerabilities to these electricity reliant systems such as weather, terrorism, and natural disasters (CNA Military Advisory Board, 2015). Electricity-reliant systems pose a complicated issue when considering adapting energy policy. Many individuals and governments are seeking “green” energy alternatives. Unfortunately, these changes are not a simple addition to established communities. When considering changing policies to improve climate change, policymakers are faced with overhauling a long-standing electric system. One potential future initiative is creating an energy source mix for communities and the national security systems (CNA Military Advisory Board, 2015). The future of energy is not simply electric power grids but a mix of energy production and delivery (CNA Military Advisory Board, 2015). Creating adaptive policies for powering infrastructure reduces the number of vulnerabilities facing the energy system and strengthens security efforts. How can energy over-reliance result in homeland security challenges in the United States and for our allies? Over-reliance on a centralized power source and grid creates many vulnerabilities. Events such as severe weather, natural disasters, manmade disasters, and terrorist threats can have a larger impact due to the reliance on this system (CNA Military Advisory Board, 2015). Additionally, many U.S. security or military installations are susceptible to the same attacks (CNA Military Advisory Board, 2015). While there are contingency plans and some backup options, the energy sector is not prepared to overcome a large-scale incident (CNA Military Advisory Board, 2015). There are high volumes of infrastructure, agriculture, and people who rely on these systems to survive. Communications, commerce, and transportation are also vulnerable to attacks on the energy sector (CNA Military Advisory Board, 2015). Should these areas be affected, it could cause issues with the homeland and allies. Reduced operational capabilities hurts the homeland but it can reduce Americas ability to collaborate and operate with other countries (CNA Military Advisory Board, 2015). An attack on America could mean an increased need for support from allies and leaves the country potentially vulnerable. Without an adaptive energy operation there is a major target for adversaries to easily cause largescale devastation. It will be a large undertaking to transition the energy sector to advanced energy options, but the switch is necessary.  References CNA Military Advisory Board. (2015, Nov).

 As Cox and Van Nostrand (2022) note, the law is a fundamental aspect of society intended to establish the rules, govern everyday actions, and organize how people live together. A society could not adequately function without a system of laws to help foster citizens' acceptance of norms and expectations and shape how people think about their actions as right or wrong under the law (Cox & Van Nostrand, 2022). This is important when bringing justice to a society undergoing changes or challenges (Cox & Van Nostrand, 2022). However, in the case of the Central African Republic (CAR), the country faces extremely weak institutional capacities, corruption, underserved populations, poor infrastructure, and a fragile government, leading to a vicious cycle (Caus, 2021). If a country's legal system is not strong, it cannot properly address conflicts or bring justice to people who have been hurt (Caus, 2021). A lack of rule of law, or a weak legal system, is connected to various issues like poverty, corruption, economic and political instability, and ongoing conflicts (Caus, 2021). Those in charge must be held accountable and make the necessary decisions to punish or allow reconciliation (Cox & Van Nostrand, 2022). Unfortunately, in the CAR, the legal system was already vulnerable, and the violence exacerbated the issue (Caus, 2021). The conflict damaged official buildings like courts and destroyed criminal records, and there were not enough trained people to handle legal matters (Caus, 2021). This means that offenders of serious crimes and human rights violations often do not face any consequences (Caus, 2021). This lack of punishment made them more confident to keep doing bad things and made people lose trust in the justice system and the government (Caus, 2021). Caus (2021) recognizes that reinforcing the rule of law is vital to stabilization and recovery. The CAR's history, as highlighted by the International Crisis Group (2017), is marked by numerous attempts at political mediation. Unfortunately, the agreements stemming from these efforts have yet to be effectively implemented, facing challenges such as corruption, instability, and armed groups (International Crisis Group, 2017). The United Nations (UN) member countries utilize forums like the Security Council (UNSC) to address conflicts through talking, diplomacy, mediation, and finding solutions together (Onuma, 2017). Despite the UN's commitment to the shared interests of the global community, some countries resist UN involvement in their internal matters (Onuma, 2017). Over time, the line between problems within a country and those affecting the world has become less pronounced, enabling the UN to step in using different methods, such as making decisions and taking strong actions (Onuma, 2017). In 2013, the UNSC passed Resolution 2127, allowing the African-led International Support Mission to the Central African Republic (MISCA) to be deployed for security restoration and civilian protection (Security Council Report, n.d.). The resolution additionally empowered the French forces in the CAR to take any required actions to support MISCA  (Security Council Report, n.d.). It also asked the Secretary-General to create an international commission of inquiry and instituted an arms embargo, sanctions committee, and a group of experts (Security Council Report, n.d.). Resolution 2149 in 2014 established the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic (MINUSCA) to replace MISCA and deal with the worsening situation (Security Council Report, n.d.). Since the end of 2016, various international and regional actors and international organizations have initiated parallel mediation endeavors (International Crisis Group, 2017). The African Union (AU) and neighboring countries of the CAR, including Angola and Chad, consolidated their individual initiatives and jointly commenced mediation in early 2017 (International Crisis Group, 2017). The catholic community Sant'Egidio also joined the mediation efforts, organizing meetings with armed groups in Rome that culminated in a political peace agreement for the CAR signed in June 2017 (International Crisis Group, 2017). However, the agreement faced renewed violence on the ground shortly afterward and failed to resolve the conflict (International Crisis Group, 2017). The 2019 Political Agreement for Peace and Reconciliation (APPR-RCA) in the CAR aimed to address the issue of impunity and discipline the people who commit serious crimes (Caus, 2021). Preceding the agreement, the AU and the UN spearheaded peace talks with support from the Economic Community of Central African States (Caus, 2021). This collaborative effort spanned a year and involved consultations with armed groups, civil society, and CAR's government to establish a shared understanding of the issues and grievances and define the terms for a dialogue (Murray & Sullivan, 2019). The U.S., the European Union (EU), and Russia supported the preparations for these talks (Murray & Sullivan, 2019). Yeini (2020) notes that mediation is like having a neutral referee or third party involved in discussions between conflicting sides. This third party can be a country, an international organization, or even a private person (Yeini, 2020). This third-party mediation can make things more equal and result in a fairer agreement, especially when one group is much stronger than the other (Yeini, 2020). In this case, the AU played a crucial role in facilitating the negotiations for over 18 months and mediating the agreement (Murray & Sullivan, 2019). The political agreement was signed by the CAR government and 14 armed groups (Murray & Sullivan, 2019). However, recurrent violations and the ongoing dominance of armed groups in significant parts of the country have caused the agreement to have inconsistent results (Caus, 2021).   The UNSC has played a role in strengthening the country's government, especially in security, justice, and policing, to combat impunity for serious crimes (Caus, 2021). Since its establishment, various resolutions have extended the MINUSCA and authorized the use of all means to provide operational support to the mission, with the most recent continuing the mission until November 2024, when the UNSC adopted Resolution 2709 (Security Council Report, n.d.; United Nations Security Council [UNSC], 2023). The renewal of the mission aims to enhance the development of political, security, and institutional conditions that foster national reconciliation and lasting peace (UNSC, 2023). The resolution calls on the mission to prioritize the protection of civilians, support the government, assist in peacekeeping and upholding ceasefires and the Political Agreement for Peace and Reconciliation, and protect UN personnel (UNSC, 2023). MINUSCA is also authorized to assist with local elections, protect human rights, aid former fighters in reintegrating into society, help take away weapons, facilitate national and international justice efforts, fight against impunity, and support the rule of law (UNSC, 2023).  References Caus, J.

The UN has been involved in mediating the Cyprus conflict since the 1960s, with the goal of reunification, but efforts have stalled since the breakdown of talks in 2017 (Ungar & Göksel, 2023). Mediation typically involves a neutral third party helping conflicting parties reach a mutually acceptable agreement (Onuma, 2017). In this context, a new envoy, if appointed, would serve as a mediator, facilitating dialogue, building trust, and guiding the parties toward a resolution. As Yeini (2020) indicated, mediation offers a gentle push for states to engage in dialogue, moving us closer to global peace. According to Yeini (2020), having the Secretary-General lead mediation is the preferable default option. While it does not claim to be a miraculous solution for bringing uncooperative states to the negotiating table, it can benefit states genuinely interested in resolving issues but facing challenges (Yeini, 2020). Making mediation the default method, with the Secretary-General as the mediator, can help states overcome the initial hurdle of starting the peacebuilding process (Yeini, 2020). Yeini (2020) suggests this is especially relevant for states with a history of hostility; involving a third party becomes crucial for effective negotiations. In such cases, mediation allows the mediator to convey ideas between parties, preserve their dignity, propose creative solutions, and provide external motivations for resolving conflicts (Yeini, 2020). In situations where states have persistent conflicts or significant differences, the involvement of a third party, like a mediator, becomes essential for successful conflict resolution (Yeini, 2020). According to Ungar and Göksel (2023), the post of the senior UN official in reunification talks has been vacant for almost two years, contributing to deteriorating relations between Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots. Ungar and Göksel (2023) propose that the Secretary-General designate an envoy tasked with formulating a roadmap containing substantial incentives to encourage the return of Greek and Turkish Cypriots to the negotiating table. Unfortunately, three main obstacles hinder the appointment of a new envoy, including substantive disagreements over terms of reference, a debate over the envoy's job title, and a fundamental lack of trust between the two sides (Ungar & Göksel, 2023). The distrust between the parties adds complexity, with Greek Cypriots eager to restart negotiations sooner while Turkish Cypriots are skeptical that a renewed process will yield different outcomes (Ungar & Göksel, 2023). Ungar and Göksel (2023) mention that both sides have reasons to make concessions and return to the negotiating table, with Greek Cypriots concerned about Ankara's influence and Turkish Cypriots seeking an equal footing in talks. The idea of a European Union (EU) envoy for Cyprus has been proposed. However, it faces challenges, as the Turkish Cypriots and Turkey are unlikely to accept an EU representative as an impartial mediator (Ungar & Göksel, 2023). Ungar and Göksel (2023) suggest that the EU could support the process by providing technical assistance aligning any agreement with the EU acquis.  References Onuma, Y.

How might the proposal of an EU envoy be navigated to enhance the negotiation process, considering the challenges and the skepticism towards an EU representative? Hello [name], I appreciate your thoughts on this conflict. Laws provide a framework, but effective peacekeeping and conflict resolution demand a multifaceted understanding that addresses the root causes, engages with diverse stakeholders, and fosters sustainable solutions. According to Onuma (2017), countries and parties involved in disputes often engage in discussions and negotiations rather than resort to formal legal actions (Onuma, 2017). This is important in recognizing that international law plays a crucial role in legal proceedings and the broader context of diplomatic negotiations and conflict resolution (Onuma, 2017). Even when legal actions are not pursued, international law can still influence and guide the discussions, agreements, and resolutions that emerge from diplomatic processes (Onuma, 2017). Regarding the Israel-Palestine conflict, this concept is highly relevant. While there have been legal aspects and international resolutions related to the conflict, a significant portion of the efforts to find a resolution have been through diplomatic channels, negotiations, and peace talks.  Conciliation is a way to settle disputes by having a third party investigate the problem and suggest solutions (Yeini, 2020). This third party, a conciliation commission, comprises unbiased experts (Yeini, 2020). The goal is for the conflicting parties to accept the suggestions based on good arguments and a willingness to end their dispute. Yeini (2020) notes that although conciliation is mentioned in international treaties, it has not been used much in real-life disputes. Yeini (2020) recognizes negotiation as an alternative that is more accessible, as it does not require complex procedures (Yeini, 2020). It relies on the negotiators' skills to find solutions and communicate effectively without a third party guiding the talks (Yeini, 2020). The choice between negotiation and mediation depends on accessibility and the parties' communication ability (Yeini, 2020).  Minges (2023) acknowledges that the fundamental desires for freedom, liberation, dignity, and security persist among Palestinians and Israelis. Unfortunately, the lesson that military solutions are ineffective and unsuitable for long-term resolutions has not been fully absorbed (Minges, 2023). Minges (2023) acknowledges that international laws and norms explicitly prohibit the targeting of civilians, hospitals, and schools, yet the Israeli offensive in Gaza has violated these principles. The central argument is that escalating destruction in Gaza undermines the prospects for future security and peace (Minges, 2023). Continuing the bombardment of civilians and homes cannot be justified as a military strategy, as it fails to yield any military advantage against Hamas fighters, militant groups, or weaponry (Minges, 2023). Minges (2023) notes that these actions can potentially destroy any future engagement with Palestinians. Unfortunately, in the case of the ongoing Israel-Palestine conflict, the current situation marked by a brittle truce and subsequent end to a brief respite highlights the ongoing complexity of the conflict. Despite the breakdown of the week-long truce and the resumption of hostilities, negotiations between Israel and Hamas persisted through intermediaries (Marquardt et al., 2023). The discussions focused on the potential release of hostages from Gaza (Marquardt et al., 2023). The Israel Defense Forces stated it would continue combat operations, accusing Hamas of violating the truce by launching rockets toward Israeli territory (Marquardt et al., 2023). Since the restart of military operations, a total of 178 people have been killed (Marquardt et al., 2023). However, Marquardt et al. (2023) recognize ongoing efforts to reinstate the truce. Discussions actively involve Israel, Hamas, Qatar, the US, and Egypt, with a particular emphasis on exploring the release of the remaining women hostages (Marquardt et al., 2023). What steps or conditions need to be met for the discussions to yield meaningful results and contribute to a lasting resolution of the Israel-Palestine conflict?

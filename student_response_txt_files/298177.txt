"Good evening class, When it comes to protecting my privacy online, I just do everything with common sense. I do not be clicking on random sketchy links as it might expose my own privacy. Hackers could use the link as a phishing link and could potentially get your IP address and approximate location. The phishing links could also be infected with malware, which is a software that can disrupt, damage, and allow unauthorized access to your device. When going out in public, I never connect to "free wifi" from places I don't trust. Even if they may be safe, hackers could get into your devices just by being in the same network. I usually just use my own data which works perfectly fine. Lastly, I do not share personal information online. It is a bit obvious but it is the best way to keep your own privacy while being online." "Good evening [name], Great topic for this week's discussion. I do find it interesting that our privacy may not be as private as we think it is. The fact that we get Google ads about stuff we just talk about is a little eerie. " "Good evening [name], Thank you for discussing the different ways people can protect their privacy online. It's truly heartbreaking that the older generation are being targeted as they don't really know how new technology works. I'd say it's a very coward-like behavior for the hackers and scammers."

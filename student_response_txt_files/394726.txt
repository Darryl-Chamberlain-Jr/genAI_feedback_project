Food Security The four main dimensions of food security are availability, accessibility, utility, and stability. These dimensions make up the condition that all people always have physical and economical access to foods for all types of dietary needs (UNDP, 1994). This notion transcends supply to encompass stability, quality, and access to nutritious food. Food production and distribution impact food security across the globe; they result in economic instability and high prices that leave many families wanting. Lastly, access to food must be steady throughout the year, through every season, and through food system shocks and unpredictable fluctuations. This human security dimension contains complex concepts that require addressing agricultural production, social safety nets, poverty reduction, education, and healthcare.  Challenges Across the Globe Challenges to food security include population growth, climate change, water pollution and scarcity, conflict, trade inequality, shifting dietary needs, and poverty. Malnutrition is a leading cause of death and disability in low-income communities as identified in Malawai (A., et al., 2022). A cost analysis conducted by Gelli et al., (2022) identified climate change as a significant contributor to food insecurity, impacting access to food which led to malnutrition. Knowledge about the right foods when food is scarce is an integral intervention in this case. In another case study by Alam et al., (2018), Malaysian food security focused on sustainable practices. Hunger has been impacted by all sectors of society, but healthy options have remained under the radar. Malaysia has been impacted by climate change, so climate and healthy foods must be integrated into development goals to meet new concerns.  Nepal has experienced food insecurities brough on by climate change, as well (Gartaula et al., 2017), but has received a different response. Outsourcing income has improved income for some families, leaving many women to make food decisions and run households by themselves. Another driver of food insecurity is that farmers are more likely to export their crops than consume them; they are forced to choose between income and quality of food. Overall, developing countries seem to experience different types of food insecurity, many of which require people to choose between quality income and quality food (Pawlak and Kolodziejczak, (2020). In developed countries like Australia, however, the issue of food security stems from the inefficiency of distribution between urban and rural producers and consumer. The relationship revealed that production of foods did not meet the quality that was demanded (Dixon and Richars, 2016). This study concluded that the agricultural sector focused too much on exporting and not enough on the nutritious value of the exported goods.  Impact of Interventions and Policy Recommendations 	Australia’s alternative food systems were implemented to encourage urban communities to grow their own foods to meet their on demands. However, this impacts rural farmers negatively by increasing competition and reducing income that farmers might otherwise depend on (Dixon and Richars, 2016). While urban farmers benefit from this intervention, rural farmers remain closer to poverty. Across the globe, rural communities suffer from higher levels of poverty already (UNDP, 1994). Another intervention that might have been successful is one that was implemented in Malawi where families were educated on nutrition (A et al., 2022). This knowledge resonated with improved diets of children. Policy recommendations should begin with shifting focus from trade to human rights. Resilience, adaptation, education are all necessary to mitigate food insecurities that millions of people face across the world. Though climate change is difficult to respond to, implementing food systems that are resilient can be done. Planned adaptation, for instance, can be designed through policy that invests in agricultural infrastructures (Alam et al., 2018). Encouraging younger generations to take interest in food security and agricultural systems can help create a brighter future for their regions as well (The State of…,2021). Policy must aim to mitigate current challenges but also plan for future ones. Ensuring safe and equal working environments for women have proven to increase the well-being of households as well (Gartaula et al., 2017). This is also the case for traditional communities that rely on caste-like systems to dictate who has access to food and income.   References A, G., Cg, K., A, M., A, T., M, K., & C, L. (2022).

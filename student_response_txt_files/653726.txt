Human actions can be detrimental to the environment. Spanning organized crimes, environmental degradation, the illegal exploitation of resources, and flawed policy responses have profoundly impacted environmental systems, leading to the escalation of transnational crimes. These actions have strained US national security concerns by fostering global political and economic destabilization across various regions.  However, based on the readings and videos, there are three principal areas of concern: The expansion of organized crime, as detailed by Glenny (2009), alongside Kelley et al. (2015), focuses on human-induced climate change exacerbating environmental crises like the severe drought in Syria and displays the multifaceted impact of ecological degradation fueled by illicit trade and organized crime. Such degradation can destabilize regions, drawing the US into military involvement or humanitarian efforts to stabilize affected areas. Illegal trade of precious minerals, deforestation, and cybercrime, along with the unauthorized logging, timber trade, and underground market of "Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated "(IUU)fishing (Bergenas & Knight, 2015; Harris, 2013), reveals the extensive environmental damage caused by these activities. This exploitation not only results in ecological degradation but also funds criminal and terrorist groups, undermining economic development and necessitating comprehensive US engagement to combat these crimes and support international sustainable development efforts. Water scarcity and the indirect environmental impact of cybercrime exemplify the broader implications of resource-based conflicts and ecosystem disruptions on political and economic stability, an instability necessitating increased US involvement to support affected regions through development aid, environmental conservation efforts, and governance-strengthening initiatives, underscoring the interconnectedness of ecological conservation, sustainable development, and global security. Upon analysis, security concerns arising from resource conflicts are exacerbated by environmental depletion and climate change, creating instability and requiring US intervention to restore peace and order. Additionally, criminal networks' exploitation of environmental resources contributes to ecological decline, deepening economic disparities and social unrest, necessitating US involvement to support affected regions, highlighting the need for a comprehensive approach to climate diplomacy and policy-making. Lastly, the global nature of organized crime, its effects on environmental systems, and its contribution to political and economic destabilization present multifaceted security concerns for the US. Therefore, addressing these challenges requires a comprehensive strategy that includes combating transnational crime, enforcing international environmental rules and regulations, and supporting global efforts to manage the root causes of instability. In conclusion, authors Glenny (2009), Kelley et al. (2015), Bergenas & Knight (2015), Harris (2013), and Canales (2013) advocate for a cross-sectoral approach that prioritizes ecological integrity, human rights, and global security; emphasizing the cruciality of international cooperation and innovation in policy-making to combat the challenges posed by environmental crime effectively and its implications for US national security (Glenny, 2009; Canales, 2013; Harris, 2013; Bergenas & Knight, 2015; Kelley et al., 2015).

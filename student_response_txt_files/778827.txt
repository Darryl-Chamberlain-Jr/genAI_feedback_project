"Unfortunately I am not the most savvy when it comes to security of my home network and I am guilty of using free public wifi from time to time. I do however utilize a VPN on my laptop and desktop sometimes but I did not start using a VPN for security reasons but rather to change my location to watch shows and things of that nature while deployed. Other precautions that I take are common are things like not clicking random links or pop-ups. I also try my best to utilize different passwords for different websites although sometimes I fail at that out of laziness. With the future of flying going towards only utilizing my own personal devices on public networks I will start to prioritize security as the thought of always sharing a public network with thousands of others at an airport sounds a bit scary. While the convenience of always having access to entertainment via your personal devices sounds great, Iâ€™m curious to see the security implemented by the providers." "It is both hilarious and scary that your mobile device that you do not want knowing your location shows you that it has your location and then lies to your face about not knowing it. I too will always opt to not share when given the option but I know in all honesty they will will still know. Great post." "Great post! Good to see you actually know your router's security settings as I had no idea what mine were. I usually just leave the settings as they come although I am pretty good about setting up a custom username and password."

"Dec 6, 2023 2:13PM [name]  Hello Class, This is my post regarding My module 1 Crisis Disaster of the Texas Power Grid Outage   Throughout history we have faced many crises either natural or man manufactured, with these at stake we come together to implement the four phase of crisis management. include mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery also included within the four phases are the three steps of crisis communication which are Pre Crisis, the crisis, and post crisis. But what happens when we have moral ethical/legal responsibilities that are broken? What are the short and long-term effects and how can they be changed for future instances? As we look further into the Texas Power Grid outage and what problems that entities such as the Electric Reliability Company of Texas (ERCOT) ran into during this Crisis' aftermath.    When we discuss moral implications regarding ERCOT’s responsibility with the Texas Power Grid outage that effected millions of people, we take a closer look at what was more important the lives of the people and their basic needs or was it to make a financial profit. According to the Texas Tribune with long time Texas native Tom “Smitty” Smith “The fault on this one is at the feet of the Legislature and the regulators for their failure to protect the people rather than profits, the utility companies, rather than investing millions of dollars in weatherization that had been recommended in review after review of these kinds of incidents. ” Rather than protecting the citizens of Texas investors wanted to protect their profits, they said that it would be too expensive for the utilities as well as the consumers. Ethically and morally the just action would do whatever they could do in their power to accommodate those in danger.    As said before, what happened was that the legislature and the regulators ERCOT included wanted to protect their profits instead of the people of Texas. The Short-term effects of this situation are that after 2 years after the disaster Texas was faced with another cold wave that could potentially affect the state and the power grid again. Legislation as well as regulators told its citizens to be optimistic about the future however, months that followed the storm, some of the companies stressed to investors the financial benefits of the two days of freezing weather and accompanying high energy prices. (Texas Tribune).  A CenterPoint spokesperson said McGoldrick was the head of the company's gas marketing division but has since left the company. She said that division was sold last year and had no role in responding to last week's storms.     The long- Term affects are that many Texans faced sky-rocketed electricity bills. Texans have already been hit with sky-high bills since last week’s event, with some climbing as high as $16,000 Links to an external site., according to The New York Times. At an emergency meeting Sunday, the three-member PUC ordered   Links to an external site. electric companies to suspend disconnections for nonpayment and delay sending invoices or bill estimates. (Texas Tribune). To this day it is an issue many Texans are faced with.    In Summation I believe first there should be Strick bylaws that hold the legislatures and regulators of Texas more responsible. Secondly, I believe that such a situation as a polar wave where houses, structures and machines are uncappable of operating in such conditions, and neither the state of Texas nor its people could predict and prepared for should not have to bear full burden. We are in an age of technology where we can better predict the weather and better communicate with individuals who may face a crisis such as a polar wave.

I agree with What you said about communication and having to spread out over a broad spectrum. It is vital to find the most sufficient ways to communicate now a days with the advances of modern technology we have no excuse when it comes to finding ways to communicate no matter where they are.   [name] from Module 8 Discussion: Ethics and Outcomes (AI Enhanced Assignment) Dec 9, 2023 5:40PM [name]  Hello [name],   Great presentation and how crazy must it have been to have to experience a disaster such as hurricane Ian. I believe that once informed or have any incline of the magnitude of such a storm people need to be as proactive as you were. If done right they could protect themselves as well as there families from potential danger. Also we as a whole need to learn how to better disseminate information to better understand what we are up against. [name]"

Some possible challenges that an electricity-reliant national security system poses for energy policy are total cost, reliability, environmental and energy security concerns, and increased exposure to disruptions. “The current US electric grid’s overreliance on aging twentieth-century technology – based on centralized power generation and interconnected distribution architecture – makes it susceptible to a wide range of threats, including severe weather and other natural disasters, direct physical attack or cyberattack and accidents associated with the age of the grid or human error” (CNA Military Advisory Board, 2015). To develop and implement an energy system is usually costly and funded by taxpayers. With that said, the responsible team must determine the cost-benefit analysis of the implementation of these systems; they must be able to determine whether the system is reliable and as well as cost-efficient in the long run. There would be environmental and energy security risks because to supply energy significant energy consumption would be involved. If no emphasis is placed on the benefits of using renewable energy as opposed to fossil fuels which pollute the atmosphere, we would witness an increase in the warmth of the earth, increase in sea levels and disruption to habitats. An electricity-reliant national security system can face disruptions from natural disasters, and cyber security threats and attacks, therefore, systems must be implemented to find and address vulnerabilities present in the system and prevent the likelihood of an outage for any reason.  	“Our dependence on assured and reliable electric power has never been greater. As one example, look no further than digital communications, which are more intrinsic to almost every aspect of our daily existence” (CNA Military Advisory Board, 2015). Energy over-reliance influences climate change, it also increases the risk of cyberattacks and has impacts on our economy. Energy over-reliance can influence climate change because to supply energy, companies will increase their usage of fossil fuels as it is the cheaper alternative. This will in turn cause excessive emissions of greenhouse gases and other pollutants that destroy the atmosphere and our ecosystems and cause a ripple effect of sorts that will lead to warmer climates, extreme weather events and rise in sea levels which homeland security and its allies will have to employ all necessary resources to address and mitigate. In our changing world, our generations are becoming more reliant on technology and its ability to allow us to freely connect with the world. The same can be said for our energy industry as they are becoming digitized to manage the movement and distribution of energy; this causes them to be a prime target for attacks by state and non-state actors which homeland security must monitor closely. Energy over-reliance can impact our economy because any disruptions in distribution of energy can affect the way in which people and industries conduct business and affect employment rates, and economic stability.

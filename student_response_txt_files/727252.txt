Dear all, I will go for the Q1. Question: \sin\theta=-0.8431 In the next step, student still in the right route. He wrote \theta=\arcsin\left(-0.8431\right). However, he did not notice that the question is asking to solve the degree for \theta , but not radian. So what he got for the answer is -1.00302212 (radians) but not -57.4689 degree. Thus, the correct answer should be \theta=-57.46893444^{\circ} However, the question is asked for the range between 0 degree and 360 degrees. So we need to add 360 degree to \theta. Final answer should be 302.53^\circ Thank you -by [name]

In our modern world, nearly every aspect of our lives depends heavily on energy, particularly electricity. From essential services like communication and transportation to critical functions such as emergency response and financial transactions, electricity is the lifeblood of our society. “The likely resulting chaos and potential social unrest will present overwhelming challenges for emergency responders, law enforcement, and public health and medical providers—providers who will be confronting the same power shortages” (CNA Military Advisory Board, 2015, p. 5). This heavy reliance on electricity for national security poses several challenges for energy policy.  First, it means we need a strong and tough energy system. If our energy infrastructure isn't up to par, it could lead to problems with important things like military bases, emergency services, and government buildings. So, we need to spend money to keep our energy systems in good shape and make sure they can handle threats like cyberattacks and natural disasters. With so much of our energy systems connected online, they become targets for hackers who could mess with our power supply or even cause blackouts. This is a big risk to our national security. “In 2008, a CIA official revealed that hackers penetrated power systems in several regions outside the United States, and in one case, caused a power outage affecting multiple cities” (CNA Military Advisory Board, 2015, p. 7). With our military and contractors supporting the military living close to the installations, power outages like that can cause real harm to those close needing to report in.  Over-relying on energy can also create problems at home and for our friends overseas. If we don't have enough energy or if we rely too much on other countries for it, it could cause big problems for our economy and safety. Plus, if there's trouble in places where we get our energy from, like the Middle East, it could hurt not only us but our allies as well. To deal with these challenges, we need to invest in making our energy systems stronger and less vulnerable to cyberattacks. We should also look into using different sources of energy and using energy more efficiently. And it's important to work together with other countries to make sure everyone stays safe and secure when it comes to energy. “The new grid must be resilient and able to withstand multiple accidents or attacks without the catastrophic collapse and associated cascading impacts affecting entire regions and major portions of the population” (CNA Military Advisory Board, 2015, p. 18). Investing in research is a step to figuring out this complex process.  CNA Military Advisory Board. (2015, November). National Security and Assured U.S. Electrical Power.

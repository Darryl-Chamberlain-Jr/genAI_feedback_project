 "My approach to online security is pretty middle ground. I am not changing passwords every 30 days or always using 16-character passwords, but I also am not doing nothing. I use a VPN on my phone because it is the device i connect to the internet the most with. I originally got the VPN while in deployment so I could watch shows that were blocked in the foreign countries I was in. It was just a nice addition that the VPN help protect me while on public networks while away from home. Another thing I do is try to have a very minimal online presence. I rarely post on Facebook or snap chat and never tie my location with the posts i do make. Security is not just passwords and firewalls, so much information about you can be deciphered just from a photo of you. My favorite example of this is Jose Monkey, where people will send a short video of their surroundings and he can find exactly where they were just by landmarks or stores. I think it is important to note that all the things we do to protect ourselves on the internet are kind of pointless to defend from somebody that really wants YOUR information. Locks just keep honest people honest. Also our phones are basically a GPS tracking device with a camera and a phone." "I agree with your point about having multiple complex passwords for each account, but I think that putting too much faith in password managers could be problematic. Attackers only have to breach the security of the manager instead of each individual account. But all the protection in the world is only good at keeping the common thief out. If they really want your info they will get it." "It's good that you're mindful about your online activity and take some precautions like avoiding oversharing personal information and being cautious with links and emails. However, I do think keeping your devices updated with software patches is crucial for security. Updates might include better encryption or protections from known exploits."

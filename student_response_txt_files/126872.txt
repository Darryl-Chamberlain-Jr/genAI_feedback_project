Here is the first sample: The most surprising thing I learned was during my research for my project, I learned that the first undersea cable that was laid between the United States and Great Britain took three years to build and lay, but only lasted about three weeks underwater before getting destroyed. In this module, the most significant communication technology covered was the internet, because the internet has become so engrained in our lives that without it, the world will some to a stand- still. With the different web1 and web 2 sites both contributing to the smooth operation of business and everyday life all around the world. I think digital technologies are more of reimagines version of their analog predecessors, because those “old school” methods were there the ideas starts. For instance, before we had things like Facebook Messenger, text messaging, or even the advent of the telephone, we needed to send actual letters to people by post, which is where the idea of long-distance communication came into play. The ability to contact someone or to send someone a message thousands of miles away without having to physically be next to that person. So instant messaging and phone calls were a direct descendant of the necessity of sending letters to people by post in the past. One question I do have that was left unanswered was “If there are two different types of websites, each having their own sets of characteristics and capabilities, why isn’t there a subcategory for websites who have both sets of characteristics and capabilities?” I intend on finding out with further online research.

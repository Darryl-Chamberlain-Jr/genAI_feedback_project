Hey everyone,Â  As mentioned in the rubric, there is no easy way to fix the issues of immigration. When it comes to illegal border crossings, militarizing the borders, increased budgets and personnel for CBP, I think one way these points can be addressed is with current technology. A combination of current CBP officers who are trained on using drones and provided night vision and thermal vision can reduce the need for a larger number of new officers. Drones, NVGs, and thermal are relatively inexpensive especially when compared to hiring, training, and maintaining even one new CBP officer. I was not able to find how much it costs to hire and train CBP officers, but I know on the military side, we were always told it cost $1 million or more to put us through training. Although this may come as a militarized approach, considering how cartels have their own NVGs, thermal vision, and drones and are using them in effective combat roles (Bunker & Sullivan, 2021). With this approach, I foresee a decrease in CBP's budget not needing to hire as many officers as long as the technology is maintained, and officers receive continued training. With transnational criminals, terrorists, and unaccompanied children, a task force between CBP, the FBI, HSI, and even child services should be sought after and strengthened. A combination of these national agencies working together with international agencies such as Interpol would be able to identify those found crossing the border and determine if they are a known terrorist or criminal. Another streamlined use of technology is a combination of drones as previously discussed, but in conjunction with AI and running individual's faces to additionally identify them and known associates. This could also be used with unaccompanied children who arrive without proper identification. There is no simple fix, but I believe using advanced technology, agencies working together to identify and appropriately deal with terrorist and criminals while also combatting the increase in human trafficking and child exploitation, and working with the countries' governments where these migrants originate from are at least a start in addressing these issues.

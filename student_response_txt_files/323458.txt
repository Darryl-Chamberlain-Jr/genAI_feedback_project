"Dec 7, 2023 8:48AM [name]  Hello Class,   The disaster I had chosen for our class assignment was Hurricane Ian.    Discuss the moral implications of risk communication and identify situations in which ethical/legal responsibilities were broken.   The following quote was taken from an article I had found regarding risk communication during Hurricane Ian,               "We could have the perfect forecast from a modeling perspective or from a weather forecasting perspective," said Marshall Shepherd, director of the atmospheric sciences program at the University of Georgia and former president of the American Meteorological Society. "But if people didn't get the information, they weren't available to hear it, or they heard it and mis-consumed it. Was it a good forecast? For starters, Shepherd said the “cone of uncertainty” is hard for people to wrap their heads around (wusf.org, 2023).    I think this is an example of the moral implications of risk communication as it relates to Hurricane Ian as well as previous and future hurricanes. For example, prior to Hurricane Ian, we (the public) were informed well in advance in of the pending storm and potential path. I recall there were questions regarding the accuracy of the information being presented in the weather forecasts. such as areas being affected out the cone, and potential storm surge. I do no think there were any ethical or legal responsibilities were broken in this risk communication process. I think we were presented information that was determined to be in the best interest of the public.    Consider what happened in the situation, the short and long-term effects, and how these effects might be mitigated in a future situation (i.e., what could have been done better).   Hurricane Ian showed us that even with proper risk communication in place and being utilized that there things that could been done better.                 "Some people have criticized weather forecasters for not translating weather risks into terms viewers and listeners can understand". Shepherd said the burden is on the public to change (wusf.org, 2023)                "I think we need to train on the other end of the spectrum," Shepherd said. "I think we need to train the public and policymakers on how to consume this information better." (wusf.org, 2023)   For example, Hurricane Ian's storm surge caused major flooding in the area in which I live. Personally, I have never experienced anything like this in previous hurricanes. I had kept up to date prior and during this storm and I made our safety planning decisions based on the information being provided. There was flooding (which was not anticipated) in the areas around my neighborhood and it took about two days before we could safely leave our neighborhood. Hurricane Ian showed that even with effective risk communication there can be issues that occur that cannot be mitigated in advance.       References;   Sheridan, K. (2023).

I think your analysis was spot on. I agree with you regarding what you have stated in the  "what can be done better" section of your post. I agree that patience is an import tool to have when the crisis is unfolding and that reporting something just to report something does not help manage the crisis. In addition, I agree with you in that there must be due diligence prior to reporting to ensure the accuracy of the information.    Respectfully,   [name] from Module 8 Discussion: Ethics and Outcomes (AI Enhanced Assignment) Dec 8, 2023 2:38PM [name]  Hi [name],   Great post! The information you provided about emergency planning for pets was very informative. My family has five pets and your post has made me re-look at our own family's emergency planning. Fortunately we have not had to evacuate during past hurricanes. Now, after reading your post, I realize that we need to do a little more planning with regards to our pets in the event that we would ever need to evacuate.    Respectfully,   [name] "
